"1","Quantum Computing of Classical Chaos: Smile of the Arnold-Schrodinger
  Cat","B. Georgeot|D. L. Shepelyansky","  We show on the example of the Arnold cat map that classical chaotic systems
can be simulated with exponential efficiency on a quantum computer. Although
classical computer errors grow exponentially with time, the quantum algorithm
with moderate imperfections is able to simulate accurately the unstable chaotic
classical dynamics for long times. The algorithm can be easily implemented on
systems of a few qubits.

"2","Quantum Communication Complexity (A Survey)","Gilles Brassard","  Can quantum communication be more efficient than its classical counterpart?
Holevo's theorem rules out the possibility of communicating more than n bits of
classical information by the transmission of n quantum bits --- unless the two
parties are entangled, in which case twice as many classical bits can be
communicated but no more. In apparent contradiction, there are distributed
computational tasks for which quantum communication cannot be simulated
efficiently by classical means. In extreme cases, the effect of transmitting
quantum bits cannot be achieved classically short of transmitting an
exponentially larger number of bits.
  In a similar vein, can entanglement be used to save on classical
communication? It is well known that entanglement on its own is useless for the
transmission of information. Yet, there are distributed tasks that cannot be
accomplished at all in a classical world when communication is not allowed, but
that become possible if the non-communicating parties share prior entanglement.
This leads to the question of how expensive it is, in terms of classical
communication, to provide an exact simulation of the spooky power of
entanglement.

"4","Formulation of Quantum Theory Using Computable and Non-Computable Real
  Numbers","T. N. Palmer","  It is shown that in two-state quantum theory, a generic quantum state can be
described by a non-computable real number. In terms of this, the criterion for
measurement outcome is simply and deterministically defined. This demonstration
is based on a construction of the Riemann sphere whose points represent, not
complex numbers, but divergent sequences with bivalent elements. Complex
structure arises from self-similar properties of a set of operators which
generate these sequences. In general, a rotation of (the coordinates of) the
sphere maps a computable real to a non-computable real. This is interpreted
physically as a mapping of a physically-measurable state to a counterfactual
state. Implications for non-locality, null measurements, many worlds and so on,
are discussed. The possible role of the Euler equation as the counterpart of
the Schrodinger equation for real-number quantum state evolution is also
outlined.

Schr\""odinger equation with the time-dependent Hamiltonian can be reduced to a

Eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian correspond to cyclic solutions of the
original Schr\""odinger equation. The nonadiabatic geometric phase of a cyclic
solution can be expressed in terms of the expectation value of the component of
the total angular momentum along the rotating axis, regardless of whether the

magnetic field, the eigenvalue problem of the effective Hamiltonian is
completely solved, and the geometric phase turns out to be a linear combination
of two solid angles. For a weak magnetic field, the same problem is solved
partly. For a general charged particle, the problem is solved approximately in
a slowly rotating magnetic field, and the geometric phases are also calculated.

"7","Geometric Phases, Symmetries of Dynamical Invariants, and Exact Solution
  of the Schrödinger Equation","Ali Mostafazadeh","  We introduce the notion of the geometrically equivalent quantum systems
(GEQS) as quantum systems that lead to the same geometric phases for a given
complete set of initial state vectors. We give a characterization of the GEQS.
These systems have a common dynamical invariant, and their Hamiltonians and
evolution operators are related by symmetry transformations of the invariant.
If the invariant is $T$-periodic, the corresponding class of GEQS includes a
system with a $T$-periodic Hamiltonian. We apply our general results to study
the classes of GEQS that include a system with a cranked Hamiltonian
$H(t)=e^{-iKt}H_0e^{iKt}$. We show that the cranking operator $K$ also belongs
to this class. Hence, in spite of the fact that it is time-independent, it
leads to nontrivial cyclic evolutions and geometric phases. Our analysis allows
for an explicit construction of a complete set of nonstationary cyclic states
of any time-independent simple harmonic oscillator. The period of these cyclic
states is half the characteristic period of the oscillator.

transverse eigenvectors and commuting components [Phys. Rev. A 59, 954 (1999)]
to body rotations described by three Euler angles. The axial angle can be made
a function of the two polar angles, and different choices of the functional
dependence are analogous to different gauges of a magnetic field. Symmetries
broken by a choice of gauge are re-established by transformations within the
gauge group. The approach allows several previous proposals to be related.
Because of the coupling of the photon momentum and spin, our position operator,
like that proposed by Pryce, is a matrix that does not commute with the spin
operator. Unlike the Pryce operator, however, our operator has commuting
components, but the commutators of these components with the total angular
momentum require an extra term to rotate the matrices for each vector component
around the momentum direction. Several proofs of the nonexistence of a photon
position operator with commuting components are based on overly restrictive
premises that do not apply here.

required to operate such a quantum engine in place of the heat bath used to run

"12","Quantum Theory From Five Reasonable Axioms","Lucien Hardy","  The usual formulation of quantum theory is based on rather obscure axioms
(employing complex Hilbert spaces, Hermitean operators, and the trace rule for
calculating probabilities). In this paper it is shown that quantum theory can
be derived from five very reasonable axioms. The first four of these are
obviously consistent with both quantum theory and classical probability theory.
Axiom 5 (which requires that there exists continuous reversible transformations
between pure states) rules out classical probability theory. If Axiom 5 (or
even just the word ""continuous"" from Axiom 5) is dropped then we obtain
classical probability theory instead. This work provides some insight into the
reasons quantum theory is the way it is. For example, it explains the need for
complex numbers and where the trace formula comes from. We also gain insight
into the relationship between quantum theory and classical probability theory.

computation, everything has to be completed within the decoherence time. High
running speed of every gate in quantum computation is demanded because the
power of quantum computer can be exponentially proportional to the maximum
number of logic gate operation that can be taken sequentially within the
decoherence time. Adiabatic condition makes any fast conditional Berry
phase(cyclic adiabatic geometric phase) shift gate impossible. Here we show
that by using a new designed sequence of simple operations with an additional

time-dependent problems where quantum effects may be relevant even after

discrete Hilbert space representation of quantum mechanical Green's operators.
We have shown that if in some discrete Hilbert space basis representation the

the corresponding Green's matrix can be calculated on the whole complex energy
plane by a continued fraction. The procedure necessitates only the analytic
calculation of the Hamiltonian matrix elements, which are used to construct the
coefficients of the continued fraction. This continued fraction representation
of the Green's operator was shown to be convergent for the bound state energy

to extend the representation to the whole complex energy plane. The presented
method provides a simple, easily applicable and analytically correct recipe for

coupling the flexural mode of the cantilever and the microscopic electronic

the dependence of interference fringe visibility on the cantilever-dot coupling

progressively destroyed as the interaction with the cantilever is turned up, in
part due to dephasing arising from the entanglement of the electron and
cantilever states and also due to the thermal smearing that results from
fluctuations in the state of the cantilever. When the dwell time of the
electron on the dot is comparable to or longer than the cantilever period, we
find coherent features in the transmission amplitude. These features are washed

this fact within classical physics which coincides with the quantum result.

Since both these express nothing but certain symmetry features of the free

empirical principle which may be understood as a generalization of the
equivalence principle. The second task of the paper is to deal with the
ontological question concerning the reality status of gauge potentials in the

interpretation of topological effects in gauge theories and, thus, the
non-reality of gauge potentials in accordance with the generalized equivalence

Schrodinger-cat paradox. Our proposed experiments ensure all fields incident on
each measurement apparatus are macroscopic. We show that an alternative
measurement scheme corresponds to balanced homodyne detection of quadrature

to conclusions about the much stronger premise of macroscopic local realism.

paradoxical interpretation of quantum mechanics is that the cat is not in one

Because of this apparent defiance of macroscopic reality, quantum
superpositions of states macroscopically distinct have generated much interest.
Here we address the issue of proving a contradiction with macroscopic reality
objectively, through the testable predictions of quantum mechanics. We consider
the premises of macroscopic reality (that the ``cat'' is either ``dead'' or
``alive'', the measurement indicating which) and macroscopic locality (that
simultaneous measurements some distance away cannot induce the macroscopic
change, ``dead'' to ``alive'' and vice versa, to the ``cat''). The predictions
of quantum mechanics for certain states, generated using states exhibiting
continuous variable entanglement, are shown to be incompatible with the
predictions of all theories based on this dual premise. Our proof is along the
lines of Bell's theorem, but where all relevant measurements give
macroscopically distinct results.

photon is wasted. This is in marked contrast to other schemes in which a random
process decides whether the next photon sent will contribute to the key or not.
The determinism is achieved by preparing the photons in two-qubit states,
rather than the one-qubit states used in conventional schemes. In particular,
we consider the realistic situation in which one qubit is the photon
polarization, the other a spatial alternative. Further, we show how one can
exploit the deterministic nature for direct secure communication, that is:
without the need for establishing a shared key first.

the help of several specific models for the dielectric constant, which are
shown to follow from the general theory by adopting particular forms of the

asymmetric boundary conditions given by Hardy class spaces ${\mathbf \Phi}_-$

respectively, rather than time symmetric Hilbert space theory. This Hardy class
boundary condition is a mathematically rigorous form of the singular
Lippmann-Schwinger equation. In addition to the rigorous definition of the

${\mathbf \Phi}_{\mp}$, one obtains Gamow kets $|[j,{\mathsf s}_R]^- >$ with

introductory part of the review is intended to be accessible to the general
reader. M-theory is an eleven-dimensional quantum theory of gravity which is
believed to underlie all superstring theories. This is the only candidate at
present for a theory of fundamental physics which reconciles gravity and
quantum field theory in a potentially realistic fashion. Evidence for the
existence of M-theory is still only circumstantial---no complete
background-independent formulation of the theory yet exists. Matrix theory was
first developed as a regularized theory of a supersymmetric quantum membrane.
More recently, the theory appeared in a different guise as the discrete
light-cone quantization of M-theory in flat space. These two approaches to
matrix theory are described in detail and compared. It is shown that matrix
theory is a well-defined quantum theory which reduces to a supersymmetric
theory of gravity at low energies. Although the fundamental degrees of freedom
of matrix theory are essentially pointlike, it is shown that higher-dimensional
fluctuating objects (branes) arise through the nonabelian structure of the
matrix degrees of freedom. The problem of formulating matrix theory in a
general space-time background is discussed, and the connections between matrix
theory and other related models are reviewed.

group P define the framework for much of particle physics on the physical
Minkowski space P/L, where L is the Lorentz group. While extraordinarily
successful, it does not provide a large enough group of symmetries to encompass
observed particles with a SU(3) classification. Born proposed the reciprocity
principle that states physics must be invariant under the reciprocity transform
that is heuristically {t,e,q,p}->{t,e,p,-q} where {t,e,q,p} are the time,
energy, position, and momentum degrees of freedom. This implies that there is
reciprocally conjugate relativity principle such that the rates of change of
momentum must be bounded by b, where b is a universal constant. The appropriate
group of dynamical symmetries that embodies this is the Canonical group C(1,3)
= U(1,3) *s H(1,3) and in this theory the non-commuting space Q= C(1,3)/
SU(1,3) is the physical quantum space endowed with a metric that is the second

encompass the spectrum of particle states. The unitary irreducible
representations of the Canonical group contain a direct product term that is a
representation of U(1,3) that Kalman has studied as a dynamical group for
hadrons. The U(1,3) representations contain discrete series that may be
decomposed into infinite ladders where the rungs are representations of U(3)

particle two-state quantum system from the initial state to the output of the
unsorted quantum search problem. The exponential propagator usually may not be
compatible with the mathematical structure and principle of the search problem
and hence is not a real quantum search network, but it can be further
decomposed into a product of a series of the oracle unitary operations such as
the selective phase-shift operations and the nonselective unitary operations
which can be expressed further as a sequence of elementary building blocks such
as one-qubit quantum gates and the two-qubit diagonal phase gates, resulting in
that the decomposed propagator is compatible with the mathematical structure

network. The decomposition for the propagator can be achieved with the help of
the operator algebra structure and symmetry of the effective Hamiltonian, and
the properties of the multiple-quantum operator algebra spaces, especially the
characteristic transformation behavior of the multiple-quantum operators under
the z-axis rotations. It has been shown that the computational complexity of

happens because the scattering theory underlying Lifshitz formula is not well
formulated when the dielectric permittivity takes account of dissipation. To
give the zeroth term of Lifshitz formula the definite meaning different
prescriptions were used recently by different authors with diversed results.
These results are shown to be improper and in disagreement with experiment and
the general physical requirements. We propose the new prescription which is a
generalization of Schwinger, DeRaad and Milton recipe formulated earlier for
ideal metals. On this base the detailed numerical and analytical computations
of the temperature Casimir force are performed in configuration of two plane

nonzero temperature and finite conductivity found in the paper are in agreement
with the limiting case of perfect metal and fit all experimental and

wavefunction could not be considered as a real ""matter wave"" and has been
provided with only abstract, formally probabilistic interpretation. In this
paper we show how the resulting ""mysteries"" of usual theory are solved within
the unreduced, dynamically multivalued description of the underlying,
essentially nonlinear interaction process (quant-ph/9902015, quant-ph/9902016),
without artificial modification of the Schroedinger equation. The latter is
rigorously derived instead as universal expression of unreduced interaction
complexity. Causal, totally realistic wavefunction is obtained as a dynamically
probabilistic intermediate state of a simple system with interaction performing
dynamically discrete transitions between its localised, incompatible
""realisations"" (""corpuscular"" states). Causal wavefunction and Schroedinger
equation are then extended to arbitrary level of world dynamics. We outline
some applications of the obtained causal description, such as genuine quantum
chaos (quant-ph/9511034-36) and realistic quantum devices (physics/0211071),
and emphasize the basic difference of the proposed dynamically multivalued
theory from dynamically single-valued imitations of causality and complexity.
The causally complete wavefunction concept, representing the unified essence of
unreduced (multivalued) complex dynamics, provides a clear distinctive feature
of realistic science, absent in any its unitary imitation.

state chosen from the known set of states. We present a principle that gives a
definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the
system and those that disturb the states. The principle is derived by
alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a
fundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple
form by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space, which is uniquely
determined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the
classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts
depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state: one
storing it classically, one storing it nonclassically, and the other one
storing no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is
inaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the
state of the system. From this principle, many types of no-cloning,
no-broadcasting, and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general
forms including mixed states. It also gives a unified view on how various
schemes of quantum cryptography work. The principle helps to derive optimum

general feature of quantum mechanics, which should lead to the inhibition of
any decay. The claim of QZE generality hinges on the assumption that successive
observations can in principle be made at time intervals too short for the
system to change appreciably. However, this assumption and the generality of
the QZE have scarcely been investigated thus far. We have addressed these
issues by showing that (i) the QZE is principally unattainable in radiative or
radioactive decay, because the required measurement rates would cause the
system to disintegrate; (ii) decay acceleration by frequent measurements (the
anti-Zeno effect -- AZE) is much more ubiquitous than its inhibition. The AZE
is shown to be observable as the enhancement of tunneling rates (e.g., for
atoms trapped in ramped-up potentials or in current-swept Josephson junctions),
fluorescence rates (e.g., for Rydberg atoms perturbed by noisy optical fields)

initial conditions. Quantum mechanics, however, does not show this feature. We
consider instead the sensitivity of quantum evolution to perturbations in the
Hamiltonian. This is observed as an atenuation of the Loschmidt Echo, $M(t)$,
i.e. the amount of the original state (wave packet of width $\sigma$) which is
recovered after a time reversed evolution, in presence of a classically weak
perturbation. By considering a Lorentz gas of size $L$, which for large $L$ is
a model for an {\it unbounded} classically chaotic system, we find numerical
evidence that, if the perturbation is within a certain range, $M(t)$ decays
exponentially with a rate $1/\tau_{\phi}$ determined by the Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda$ of the corresponding classical dynamics. This exponential decay
extends much beyond the Eherenfest time $t_{E}$ and saturates at a time
$t_{s}\simeq \lambda^{-1}\ln (\widetilde{N})$, where $\widetilde{N}\simeq
(L/\sigma)^2$ is the effective dimensionality of the Hilbert space. Since $\tau

first for a central 2-level system coupled to these environments- the results

SQUIDs, where large-scale tunneling of magnetisation and flux take place.
Decoherence in these systems is caused principally by coupling to electrons and
nuclear spins, the spin bath couplings are particularly dangerous at low $T$.
  These models are also generalised to discuss quantum measurements in which
the measured system, the measuring apparatus, and the environment are treated
quantum mechanically. The results can be used to calculate the dynamics of
coupled SQUIDs and/or nanomagnets, in which one acts as a measuring apparatus
and the other exhibits large-scale quantum superpositions. The same model can
be used to describe coupled qubits.

however, that a many-body system with zero-range potentials is unstable against
clusterization into collapsed three-body subsystems. We show that neither the
density dependence of the potential nor an additional repulsive three-body
potential can prevent this unexpected correlational collapse if the potentials
are of zero range. Therefore the zero-range potential can only be used in
many-body calculations where all three-body correlations are explicitly
excluded.

  distinctness","Peter Hoyer|Jan Neerbek|Yaoyun Shi","  We consider the quantum complexities of the following three problems:
searching an ordered list, sorting an un-ordered list, and deciding whether the
numbers in a list are all distinct. Letting N be the number of elements in the
input list, we prove a lower bound of \frac{1}{\pi}(\ln(N)-1) accesses to the
list elements for ordered searching, a lower bound of \Omega(N\log{N}) binary
comparisons for sorting, and a lower bound of \Omega(\sqrt{N}\log{N}) binary
comparisons for element distinctness. The previously best known lower bounds
are {1/12}\log_2(N) - O(1) due to Ambainis, \Omega(N), and \Omega(\sqrt{N}),
respectively. Our proofs are based on a weighted all-pairs inner product
argument.
  In addition to our lower bound results, we give a quantum algorithm for
ordered searching using roughly 0.631 \log_2(N) oracle accesses. Our algorithm
uses a quantum routine for traversing through a binary search tree faster than
classically, and it is of a nature very different from a faster algorithm due
to Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, and Sipser.

the Hilbert space, the Heisenberg rule, the free Hamiltonian... We show that
General Quantum Axiomatics (up to a supplementary ""axiom of classicity"") can be
used as a non-standard mathematical ground to formulate all the ideas and
equations of ordinary Classical Statistical Mechanics. So the question of a
""true quantization"" with ""h"" must be seen as an independent problem not
directly related with quantum formalism. Moreover, this non-standard
formulation of Classical Mechanics exhibits a new kind of operation with no
classical counterpart: this operation is related to the ""quantization process"",

into Quantum Mechanics, giving all operators of Quantum Mechanics and
Schrodinger equation. Moreover spins for particles are naturally generated,
including an approximation of their interaction with magnetic fields. We find
also that this approach gives a natural semi-classical formalism: some exact

both logical and analytical connection between classical and quantum pictures.

because a time efficient quantum computation is a reversible physical process.
The paper is organized as follows. The first section reviews the classical

designs used in the classical framework to decrease the consumption of space
cannot be generalized to the quantum case; it is also suggested that quantum
computing is generally more demanding of space than classical computing. In the

The computational power of this automaton is at least equal to that of

  model","Armen E. Allahverdyan|Roger Balian|Theo M. Nieuwenhuizen","  A model of quantum measurement is proposed, which aims to describe
statistical mechanical aspects of this phenomenon, starting from a purely
Hamiltonian formulation. The macroscopic measurement apparatus is modeled as an
ideal Bose gas, the order parameter of which, that is, the amplitude of the
condensate, is the pointer variable. It is shown that properties of
irreversibility and ergodicity breaking, which are inherent in the model
apparatus, ensure the appearance of definite results of the measurement, and
provide a dynamical realization of wave-function reduction or collapse. The
measurement process takes place in two steps: First, the reduction of the state
of the tested system occurs over a time of order $\hbar/(TN^{1/4})$, where $T$
is the temperature of the apparatus, and $N$ is the number of its degrees of
freedom. This decoherence process is governed by the apparatus-system
interaction. During the second step classical correlations are established
between the apparatus and the tested system over the much longer time-scale of
equilibration of the apparatus. The influence of the parameters of the model on
non-ideality of the measurement is discussed. Schr\""{o}dinger kittens, EPR

there exist states with the following properties: (i) Its reduced density
operator is completely equivalent to a vector state of the subsystems for any
gauge-invariant observable of the subsystems. (ii) The vector state is a simple
product of vector states of individual subsystems, each of which is not an
eigenstate of the charge of each subsystem. Furthermore, one can associate to
each subsystem its vector state, which is a pure state, and observables which
are not necessarily gauge invariant in each subsystem. These results justify
taking (a) superpositions of states with different charges, and (b)
non-gauge-invariant operators, such as the order parameter of the breaking of
the gauge symmetry, as observables, for subsystems.

corresponds to the magnetic field being perpendicular to the Ising orientation
(z direction). In the low temperature limit, we find that varying the angle of
the magnetic field very slightly from the z direction leads to a rapid rise in
entanglement. We also find that the orientation of the magnetic field for
maximum entanglement varies with the field amplitude. Furthermore, we have
derived a simple rule for the mixing of concurrences (a measure of

the algorithm. We thus investigate the behaviour of entanglement in Shor's
algorithm for small numbers of qubits by classical computer simulation of the
quantum computer at different stages of the algorithm. We find that
entanglement is an intrinsic part of the algorithm and that the entanglement
through the algorithm appears to be closely related to the amount of mixing.
Furthermore, if the computer is in a highly mixed state any attempt to remove
entanglement by further mixing of the algorithm results in a significant
decrease in its efficiency.

Alice and Bob. This shows a clear advantage of the six-state scheme over
another standard scheme---BB84, which has been proven to be secure up to only
about 11 percents, if only one-way classical communications are allowed. Our
proof technique is a generalization of that of Shor-Preskill's proof of
security of BB84. We show that a advantage of the six-state scheme lies in the
Alice and Bob's ability to establish rigorously from their test sample the
non-trivial mutual information between the bit-flip and phase error patterns. A
modified version of the degenerate quantum codes studied by DiVincenzo, Shor

structured reservoir of quantum EM field modes, with particular relevance to
atoms interacting with the field in high Q cavities or photonic band gap
materials. In cases such as the former, we show that the pseudo mode theory for
single quantum reservoir excitations can be obtained by applying the Fano
diagonalisation method to a system in which the atomic transitions are coupled
to a discrete set of (cavity) quasimodes, which in turn are coupled to a
continuum set of (external) quasimodes with slowly varying coupling constants
and continuum mode density. Each pseudomode can be identified with a discrete
quasimode, which gives structure to the actual reservoir of true modes via the
expressions for the equivalent atom-true mode coupling constants. The quasimode
theory enables cases of multiple excitation of the reservoir to now be treated
via Markovian master equations for the atom-discrete quasimode system.
Applications of the theory to one, two and many discrete quasimodes are made.
For a simple photonic band gap model, where the reservoir structure is
associated with the true mode density rather than the coupling constants, the
single quantum excitation case appears to be equivalent to a case with two
discrete quasimodes.

quantum operations on the controller only.
  It turns out that a measurement of the observable A and an implementation of
the one-parameter group exp(iAr) can be performed by almost the same sequence
of control operations. Furthermore measurement procedures for A+B, for (AB+BA),

the algebraic structure of the set of observables can be explained by the Lie
group structure of the unitary evolutions on the joint Hilbert space of the
measuring device and the measured system.

using semiconductors, composed of more than one material combined with a metal

predicting the transmission of low-temperature electrons in such a tube. This
problem is mathematically related to the transmission of acoustic or
electromagnetic waves in a two-dimensional duct. The tube is asymptotically

the so-called Building Block Method. Conformal mapping techniques are then
applied to transform the simple tube with curvature and varying cross-section

Stable formulations for the scattering operators in terms of ordinary
differential equations are formulated by wave splitting using an invariant
imbedding technique. The mathematical framework is also generalised to handle
tubes with edges, which are of large technical interest. The numerical method
consists of using a standard MATLAB ordinary differential equation solver for

reality in which we are imbedded, and settles for practical rules describing
connections between our observations. Many physicist have regarded this
renunciation of our effort to describe nature herself as premature, and John
von Neumann reformulated quantum theory as a theory of an evolving objective
universe interacting with human consciousness. This interaction is associated
both in Copenhagen quantum theory and in von Neumann quantum theory with a
sudden change that brings the objective physical state of a system in line with
a subjectively felt psychical reality. The objective physical state is thereby
converted from a material substrate to an informational and dispositional
substrate that carries both the information incorporated into it by the
psychical realities, and certain dispositions for the occurrence of future
psychical realities. The present work examines and proposes solutions to two
problems that have appeared to block the development of this conception of
nature. The first problem is how to reconcile this theory with the principles
of relativistic quantum field theory; the second problem is to understand
whether, strictly within quantum theory, a person's mind can affect the
activities of his brain, and if so how. Solving the first problem involves
resolving a certain nonlocality question. The proposed solution to the second

is treated as the parameter taking values between zero and some nonvanishing

algebra becomes equivalent to the algebra of observables of quantum mechanical
system defined in the standard manner by operators in the Hilbert space. For
the vanishing Planck constant, the generalized algebra gives the operator
formulation of classical mechanics since it is equivalent to the algebra of
variables of classical mechanical system defined, as usually, by functions over
the phase space. In this way, the semiclassical limit of kinematical part of
quantum mechanics is established through the generalized operatorial framework.

exponentially to the system dimension when the classical dynamics are chaotic.
The long-time behaviour of the quantum probability distributions and, in
particular, the parameter-dependent rates of relaxation to the equilibrium
state are surprisingly well approximated by the classical Liouville mechanics
even for small quantum numbers. As the accessible classical phase space becomes
predominantly chaotic, the classical and quantum probability equilibrium
configurations approach the microcanonical distribution, although the quantum
equilibrium distributions exhibit characteristic `minimum' fluctuations away
from the microcanonical state. The magnitudes of the quantum-classical
differences arising from the equilibrium quantum fluctuations are studied for
both pure and mixed (dynamically entangled) quantum states. In both cases the
standard deviation of these fluctuations decreases as $(\hbar/{\mathcal

conclusion, under a variety of conditions the differences between quantum and

Fluorescence from short, nearly isolated, quantum wires is predicted to drop

"344","Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum
  Mechanics","Mark A. Rubin","  Bell's theorem depends crucially on counterfactual reasoning, and is
mistakenly interpreted as ruling out a local explanation for the correlations
which can be observed between the results of measurements performed on
spatially-separated quantum systems. But in fact the Everett interpretation of
quantum mechanics, in the Heisenberg picture, provides an alternative local
explanation for such correlations. Measurement-type interactions lead, not to
many worlds but, rather, to many local copies of experimental systems and the
observers who measure their properties. Transformations of the
Heisenberg-picture operators corresponding to the properties of these systems
and observers, induced by measurement interactions, ""label"" each copy and
provide the mechanism which, e.g., ensures that each copy of one of the
observers in an EPRB or GHZM experiment will only interact with the ""correct""
copy of the other observer(s). The conceptual problem of nonlocality is thus
replaced with a conceptual problem of proliferating labels, as correlated
systems and observers undergo measurement-type interactions with
newly-encountered objects and instruments; it is suggested that this problem
may be resolved by considering quantum field theory rather than the quantum
mechanics of particles.

problems:
  1. Recognition of eigenvalues with fixed precision. Given a quantum circuit
generating unitary mapping $U$ and a complex number the problem is to determine
is it an eigenvalue of $U$ or not.
  2. Given a molecular structure find thermodynamic functions like partitioning
function, entropy, etc. for a gas consisting of such molecules.
  3. Recognition of molecular structures. Find a molecular structure given its
spectrum.
  4. Recognition of electronic devices. Given an electronic device that can be
used only as a black box how to recognize its internal construction?
  We consider mainly structures generating sparse spectrums. These algorithms
require the time from about square root to logarithm of the time of classical
analogs and for the first three problems give exponential memory saving. Say,
the time required for distinguishing two devices with the same given spectrum
is about seventh root of the time of direct classical method, for the
recognition of eigenvalue - about sixth root. Thus microscopic quantum devices
can recognize molecular structures and physical properties of environment
faster than big classical computers.

velocity of the aether wind -- through measuring the largest seasonal decrease
in the ratio of the summer shift of the interference fringe to the winter one
(equaled ~12%). It gave the same interval of values of the projections of the
aether wind velocity as the first method. More than hundred years there
persists a belief that Michelson-type interferometer can not be adjusted such
as to detect effects of the first order with respect to v/c. Below I show that
it is possible, and more successfully than on the interferometer of the second
order. In contrast to the traditional approach, in the interferometer of the
first order the light after splitting on a semi-transparent plate propagates in
both arms to the reflecting mirrors in one optical medium, and returns after
reflection from the mirrors through another optical medium. The shift of the
interference fringe was found to be proportional to the difference of
dielectric permittivities of these media. The horizontal projection of the
Earth's velocity relative to luminiferous aether measured by the first order

of elementary excitations of space - inertons - surrounding the particle. It is
assumed that such a motion leads not only to the spatial oscillation of the
particle along a path but to the oscillation of the particle centre-of-mass as
well. This phenomenon culminating in the anisotropic pulsation of the particle
is associated with the notion of spin. The particle-space interaction is
treated as the origin of the matter waves, which are identified with the
particle inertia and inertons surrounding the moving particle are considered as
carriers of its inert properties. Inertons are also identified with real
carriers of the gravitational interaction and the range of the particle
gravitational potential is evaluated by the inerton cloud amplitude

  chaotic many-body systems","V. V. Flambaum|F. M. Izrailev","  Highly excited many-particle states in quantum systems such as nuclei, atoms,
quantum dots, spin systems, quantum computers etc., can be considered as
``chaotic'' superpositions of mean-field basis states (Slater determinants,
products of spin or qubit states). This is due to a very high level density of
many-body states that are easily mixed by a residual interaction between
particles (quasi-particles). For such systems, we have derived simple
analytical expressions for the time dependence of energy width of wave packets,
as well as for the entropy, number of principal basis components and inverse
participation ratio, and tested them in numerical experiments. It is shown that
the energy width $\Delta (t)$ increases linearly and very quickly saturates.
The entropy of a system increases quadratically, $S(t) \sim t^2$ at small
times, and after, can grow linearly, $S(t) \sim t$, before the saturation.
Correspondingly, the number of principal components determined by the entropy,
$N_{pc} \sim exp{(S(t))}$, or by the inverse participation ratio, increases
exponentially fast before the saturation. These results are explained in terms
of a cascade model which describes the flow of excitation in the Fock space of
basis components. Finally, a striking phenomenon of damped oscillations in the
Fock space at the transition to an equilibrium is discussed.

of unequal oscillator strengths of the transitions is considered. Durations of

shorter than any of the relevant atomic relaxation times. We propose analytical
and numerical solutions of a self-consistent set of coupled Schr\""{o}dinger

oscillator strengths. It is shown that envelopes of the pulses slightly change
throughout the medium length at the initial stage of propagation. This distance
can be large compared to the one-photon resonant absorption length. Eventually,
the probe pulse is completely reemitted into the coupling pulse during

applied electric field, thus revealing induced bound state decay in first order
perturbation theory. This imaginary part results from the coupling of the

generated by illuminating them simultaneously with a single laser resonant with
the ionic carrier frequency. The ac Stark-shift induces simultaneous `virtual'
two-phonon transitions via several motional modes. Within a certain laser
intensity range these transitions can interfere constructively, resulting in a
relatively fast, heating-resistant two-qubit logic gate.

parabolic-potential channel and exposed to a homogeneous magnetic field under
influence of a potential perturbation $W$. If $W$ is bounded and periodic along
the channel, a perturbative argument yields the absolute continuity of the
bottom of the spectrum. We show it can have any finite number of open gaps
provided the confining potential is sufficiently strong. However, if $W$
depends on the periodic variable only, we prove by Thomas argument that the
whole spectrum is absolutely continuous, irrespectively of the size of the
perturbation. On the other hand, if $W$ is small and satisfies a weak
localization condition in the the longitudinal direction, we prove by Mourre
method that a part of the absolutely continuous spectrum persists.

of N atoms coupled to M modes inside a coherently driven high-finesse cavity.
The description includes momentum diffusion via spontaneous emission and cavity
decay. Simple analytical formulas for the steady-state temperature and the
cooling time for a single atom are derived and show surprisingly good agreement
with direct stochastic simulations of the semiclassical equations for N atoms
with properly scaled parameters. A thorough comparison with standard free-space
Doppler cooling is performed and yields a lower temperature and a cooling time
enhancement by a factor of M times the square of the ratio of the atom-field
coupling constant to the cavity decay rate. Finally it is shown that laser
cooling with negligible spontaneous emission should indeed be possible,
especially for relatively light particles in a strongly coupled field
configuration.

condition of separability. In this way, provided the spatial separation of
systems is sufficient to ensure EPR's locality hypothesis, it is shown how a

demonstration of the EPR gedanken experiment. Using hidden variables it is
explained how such demonstrations are a direct manifestation of the

electrodynamics more complex closed orbits also appear to exist. Tunneling
behavior of the classical tachyon is observed at classical turning points

"175","Jump time and passage time: the duration of a quantum transition","L. S. Schulman","  Under unitary evolution, systems move gradually from state to state. An
unstable atom has amplitude in its original state after many lifetimes
($\tau_L$). But in the laboratory, transitions seem to go instantaneously, as
suggested by the term ""quantum jump.""
  The problem studied here is whether the ""jump"" can be assigned a duration, in
theory and in experiment. Two characteristic times are defined, jump time
($\tau_J$) and passage time ($\tau_P$). Both use Zeno time, $\tau_Z$, defined
in terms of $H$ and its initial state as $\tau_Z \equiv \hbar/\sqrt{<\psi|
(H-E_\psi)^2 |\psi>}$, with $E_\psi \equiv <\psi|H|\psi>$.
  $\tau_J$ is defined in terms of the time needed to slow (\`a la the quantum
Zeno effect) the decay: $\tau_J \equiv \tau_Z^2/\tau_L$. It appears in several
contexts. It is related to tunneling time in barrier penetration. Its inverse
is the bandwidth of the Hamiltonian, in a time-energy uncertainty principle.
$\tau_J$ is also an indicator of the duration of the quadratic decay regime in
both experiment and in numerical calculations (cf. Fig.~2 of PRA 57,1509
(1998).)
  The passage time, $\tau_P$, arises from unitary evolution sans
interpretation. It is based on a bound of Fleming (Nuov. Cim. 16 A, 232
(1973)): for any $H$ and $\psi$ a system cannot evolve to a state orthogonal to
$\psi$ for $t< \tau_P \equiv \pi \tau_Z/2$. By including apparatus in $H$,
$\tau_P$ limits the observation of decay according to the quantum measurement
ideas proposed in ""Time's Arrows and Quantum Measurement,"" Cambridge U. Press,
1997, thereby allowing an experimental test of these ideas.

which uses methods analogous to those of conventional multiparticle quantum
mechanics. Emphasis is placed on the (Schr\""odinger picture) states of the
system, described in terms of Slater determinants of Dirac states, and not on
the field operator $\hat{\psi}(x)$ (which is superfluous in this approach). The
vacuum state `at time $\tau$' is defined as the Slater determinant of a basis
for the span of the negative spectrum of the `first quantized' Hamiltonian
$\hat{H}(\tau)$, thus providing a concrete realisation of the Dirac Sea. The
general S-matrix element of the theory is derived in terms of time-dependent
Bogoliubov coefficients, demonstrating that the S-matrix follows directly from
the definition of inner product between Slater determinants. The process of
`Hermitian extension', inherited directly from conventional multiparticle
quantum mechanics, allows second quantized operators to be defined without
appealing to a complete set of orthonormal modes, and provides an extremely
straightforward derivation of the general expectation value of the theory. The
concept of `radar time', advocated by Bondi in his work on k-calculus, is used
to generalise the particle interpretation to an arbitrarily moving observer. A
definition of particle results, which depends {\it only} on the observer's
motion and the background present, not on any choice of coordinates or gauge,
or of the particle detector. We relate this approach to conventional methods by
comparing and contrasting various derivations. Our particle definition can be
viewed as a generalisation to arbitrary observers of Gibbons' approach.

states. At the bottom of this hierarchy are the partial density of states for
which represent the contribution to the local density of states if both the
incident and outgoing scattering channel are prescribed. On the next higher
level is the injectivity which represents the contribution to the local density
of states if only the incident channel is prescribed regardless of the final
scattering channel. The injectivity is related by reciprocity to the emissivity
of a point into a quantum channel. The sum of all partial density of states or
the sum of all injectivities or the sum of all emissivities is equal to the
local density of states. The use of the partial density of states is
illustrated for a number of different electron transport problems in mesoscopic
physics: The transmission from a tunneling tip into a mesoscopic conductor, the
discussion of inelastic or phase breaking scattering with a voltage probe, and
the ac-conductance of mesoscopic conductors. The transition from a capacitive

local hidden-variable model fails in reproducing the whole set of

different approaches. In the first approach, the local realistic observables
are deduced from the most general premises concerning locality and realism, and
Bell-like inequalities are not employed. The other approach makes use of Bell's
inequalities. Under particular conditions for the detection times, within the
first approach the discrepancy between quantum mechanics and local realism for
the asymmetry parameter turns out to be not less than 20%. A similar
incompatibility can be made evident by means of a Bell-type test, by employing
a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt's inequality written in terms of properly
normalized observables. Because of its relatively low experimental accuracy,
the data obtained by the CPLEAR collaboration do not yet allow a decisive test
of local realism. Such a test, both with and without the use of Bell's

"595","Information-theoretic approach to the study of control systems","Hugo Touchette|Seth Lloyd","  We propose an information-theoretic framework for analyzing control systems
based on the close relationship of controllers to communication channels. A
communication channel takes an input state and transforms it into an output
state. A controller, similarly, takes the initial state of a system to be
controlled and transforms it into a target state. In this sense, a controller
can be thought of as an actuation channel that acts on inputs to produce
desired outputs. In this transformation process, two different control
strategies can be adopted: (i) the controller applies an actuation dynamics
that is independent of the state of the system to be controlled (open-loop
control); or (ii) the controller enacts an actuation dynamics that is based on
some information about the state of the controlled system (closed-loop
control). Using this communication channel model of control, we provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be perfectly controllable
and perfectly observable in terms of information and entropy. In addition, we
derive a quantitative trade-off between the amount of information gathered by a
closed-loop controller and its relative performance advantage over an open-loop
controller in stabilizing a system. This work supplements earlier results [H.
Touchette, S. Lloyd, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1156 (2000)] by providing new
derivations of the advantage afforded by closed-loop control and by proposing
an information-based optimality criterion for control systems. New applications
of this approach pertaining to proportional controllers, and the control of
chaotic maps are also presented.

paradoxes, which ordinarily have been dismissed on the grounds of
counter-factuality. Instead, we claim that such paradoxes point to a deeper
logical structure inherent to quantum mechanics, which is naturally described
in the language of weak values, and which is accessible experimentally via weak
measurements. Using as an illustration, a gedanken-experiment due to
Hardy\cite{hardy}, we show that there is in fact an exact numerical coincidence
between a) a pair of classically contradictory assertions about the locations
of an electron and a positron, and b) the results of weak measurements of their
location. The internal consistency of these results is due to the novel way by
which quantum mechanics ""resolves"" the paradox: first, by allowing for two
distinguishable manifestations of how the electron and positron can be at the
same location: either as single particles or as a pair; and secondly, by
allowing these properties to take either sign. In particular, we discuss the
experimental meaning of a {\em negative} number of electron-positron pairs.

that PPVs always have a higher energy than the SGS, and we derive a lower bound

much larger than the excitation energies of low-lying excited states for a
large V. We also discuss the collapse time of PPVs for interacting many bosons.
It is shown that the wave function collapses in a microscopic time scale,
because PPVs are not energy eigenstates. We show, however, that for PPVs the

quantum key distribution by replacing bulk optical components at the end

fiber-optic arrangement provides stable, efficient and high-contrast routing of
the photons. The low bit error rate leads to high error correction efficiency
and minimizes data sacrifice during privacy amplification. Characterization

""quantum cell probe model"". We prove a lower bound for the static predecessor
problem in the address-only version of this model where we allow quantum
parallelism only over the `address lines' of the queries. The address-only
quantum cell probe model subsumes the classical cell probe model, and many
quantum query algorithms like Grover's algorithm fall into this framework. Our
lower bound improves the previous known lower bound for the predecessor problem
in the classical cell probe model with randomised query schemes, and matches
the classical deterministic upper bound of Beame and Fich. Beame and Fich have
also proved a matching lower bound for the predecessor problem, but only in the
classical deterministic setting. Our lower bound has the advantage that it
holds for the more general quantum model, and also, its proof is substantially
simpler than that of Beame and Fich. We prove our lower bound by obtaining a
round elimination lemma for quantum communication complexity. A similar lemma
was proved by Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson for classical communication
complexity, but it was not strong enough to prove a lower bound matching the
upper bound of Beame and Fich. Our quantum round elimination lemma also allows
us to prove rounds versus communication tradeoffs for some quantum
communication complexity problems like the ""greater-than"" problem. We also
study the ""static membership"" problem in the quantum cell probe model.
Generalising a result of Yao, we show that if the storage scheme is implicit,
that is it can only store members of the subset and `pointers', then any

traditional transistor-based technology at the nanoscale. When modeling a QCA
circuit, the number of degrees of freedom necessary to describe the quantum
mechanical state increases exponentially making modeling even modest size cell
arrays difficult. The intercellular Hartree approximation largely reduces the
number of state variables and still gives good results especially when the
system remains near ground state. This suggests that large part of the
correlation degrees of freedom are not essential from the point of view of the
dynamics. In certain cases, however, such as for example the majority gate with
unequal input legs, the Hartree approximation gives qualitatively wrong
results. An intermediate model is constructed between the Hartree approximation
and the exact model, based on the coherence vector formalism. By including
correlation effects to a desired degree, it improves the results of the Hartree
method and gives the approximate dynamics of the correlation terms. It also
models the majority gate correctly. Beside QCA cell arrays, our findings are
valid for Ising spin chains in transverse magnetic field, and can be
straightforwardly generalized for coupled two-level systems with a more
complicated Hamiltonian.

of generalized coherent states in a manner that accounts for interference,
entanglement, and the linearity of dynamics without using the superposition
principle. The coherent state labels, which are essentially instructions for
preparing states, make it unnecessary to identify properties with projectors in
Hilbert space. This eliminates the so called ""eigenvalue-eigenstate"" link, and
the theory thereby escapes the measurement problem. What the theory allows us
to predict is the distribution in the outcomes of tests of relations between
coherent states. It is shown that quantum non-determinism can be attributed to
a hidden variable (noise) in the space of relations without violating the no-go
theorems (e.g. Kochen-Specker). It is shown that the coherent state vacuum is
distorted when entangled states are generated. The non-locality of the vacuum
permits this distortion to be felt everywhere without the transmission of a
signal and thereby accounts for EPR correlations in a manifestly covariant way.

coupled to a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators is investigated. Upon
applying the numerical quasiadiabatic propagator path integral method, we
obtain the numerically precise time-resolved evolution of this interacting
two-qubit system in presence of time-dependent external fields without further
approximations. We simulate the dissipative gate operation for characteristic
experimental realizations of condensed matter qubits; namely, the flux and
charge qubits realized in superconducting Josephson systems and qubits formed
with semiconductor quantum dots. Moreover, we study systematically the quality
of the XOR gate by determining the four characteristic gate quantifiers:
fidelity, purity, the quantum degree, and the entanglement capability of the
gate. Two different types of errors in the qubits have been modelled, i.e.,
bit-flip errors and phase errors. The dependence of the quality of the gate
operation on the environmental temperature, on the friction strength stemming
from the system-bath interaction, and on the strength of the interqubit
coupling is systematically explored: Our main finding is that the four gate
quantifiers depend only weakly on temperature, but are rather sensitive to the
friction strength.

proportional to the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the boundary. Lorentz

continuous-time case, the probability distribution is {\em exactly} uniform at

definition of mixing time for quantum walks. Even though the continuous-time
walk has an O(n) instantaneous mixing time at which it is precisely uniform, it
never approaches the uniform distribution when the stopping time is chosen
randomly as in [AharonovAKV2001]. Our analysis treats interference between
terms of different phase more carefully than is necessary for the walk on the

whom regularly circuit this archive, including Howard Barnum, Paul Benioff,
Charles Bennett, Herbert Bernstein, Doug Bilodeau, Gilles Brassard, Jeffrey
Bub, Carlton Caves, Gregory Comer, Robert Griffiths, Adrian Kent, Rolf
Landauer, Hideo Mabuchi, David Mermin, David Meyer, Michael Nielsen, Asher
Peres, John Preskill, Mary Beth Ruskai, Ruediger Schack, Abner Shimony, William
Wootters, Anton Zeilinger, and many others. The singular thread sewing all the
letters together is the quantum. Some of the pieces are my best efforts to date
to give substance to an evanescent thought I see rising from the field of
quantum information---I call it the Paulian idea. To the extent I have
communicated its misty shadow to my correspondents and seen a twinkle of
enthusiasm, it seemed worthwhile to expand the jury on this anniversary
occasion.

"597","Opposite Arrows of Time Can Reconcile Relativity and Nonlocality","Sheldon Goldstein|Roderich Tumulka","  We present a quantum model for the motion of N point particles, implying
nonlocal (i.e., superluminal) influences of external fields on the
trajectories, that is nonetheless fully relativistic. In contrast to other
models that have been proposed, this one involves no additional space-time
structure as would be provided by a (possibly dynamical) foliation of
space-time. This is achieved through the interplay of opposite microcausal and
macrocausal (i.e., thermodynamic) arrows of time.

transition in a single atom. The qualitative difference between the
representations of plane and spherical waves of photons is examined. In
particular, the spatial inhomogeneity of the zero-point oscillations of
multipole field is shown. We show that the vacuum noise of polarization is
concentrated in a certain vicinity of atoms where it strongly exceeds the level
predicted by the representation of the plane waves. A new general polarization
matrix is proposed. It is shown that the polarization and its vacuum noise
strongly depend on the distance from the source.

quantum information theory to evaluation of information transmission capacity
of optical channel are interesting subjects. In this review paper, we will
point out that the formulation based on only classical-quantum channel mapping
model may be inadequate when one takes into account a power constraint for
noisy channel. To define the power constraint well, we should explicitly
consider how quantum states are conveyed through a transmission channel. Basing
on such consideration, we calculate a capacity formula for an attenuated noisy
optical channel with genreral Gaussian state input; this gives certain progress
beyond the example in our former paper.

transitions between magnetically split F=1 atomic sublevels, in the presence of

a finite number of bound bands followed by a continuum band when both $a$ and
$b$ take integer values. Further, if $a$ and $b$ are unequal integers, we show
that there must exist some zero band-gap states, i.e. doubly degenerate states
with the same number of nodes. More generally, in case $a$ and $b$ are not
integers, but either $a + b$ or $a - b$ is an integer ($a \ne b$), we again
show that several of the band-gaps vanish due to degeneracy of states with the
same number of nodes. Finally, when either $a$ or $b$ is an integer and the
other takes a half-integral value, we obtain exact analytic solutions for
several mid-band states.

generating a realistic atomic trajectory using a semiclassical simulation

advent of quantum theory, with respect to appropriate formalisation, validity

subject up to the 1980s is provided by a combination of the reviews of Jammer
(1974), Bauer and Mello (1978), and Busch (1990). More recent reviews are
concerned with different specific aspects of the subject. The purpose of this
chapter is to show that different types of time energy uncertainty relation can
indeed be deduced in specific contexts, but that there is no unique universal
relation that could stand on equal footing with the position-momentum
uncertainty relation. To this end, we will survey the various formulations of a
time energy uncertainty relation, with a brief assessment of their validity,
and along the way we will indicate some new developments that emerged since the
1990s.

consequences, like the Casimir effect which is now measured with good accuracy
and agreement with theory, provided that the latter accounts for differences
between real experiments and the ideal situation considered by Casimir. But the
vacuum energy density calculated by adding field mode energies is much larger
than the density observed around us through gravitational phenomena. This
``vacuum catastrophe'' is one of the unsolved problems at the interface between
quantum theory on one hand, inertial and gravitational phenomena on the other
hand. It is however possible to put properly formulated questions in the
vicinity of this paradox. These questions are directly connected to observable
effects bearing upon the principle of relativity of motion in quantum vacuum.

linear transformation a nonlinear function of any of the fundamental quadrature
operators $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, making the original Bogoliubov transformation
quadrature--dependent. Remarkably, the conditions of canonicity do not impose
any constraint on the form of the nonlinear function, and lead to a set of
nontrivial algebraic relations between the $c$--number coefficients of the
transformation. We examine in detail the structure and the properties of the
new quantum states defined as eigenvectors of the transformed annihilation
operator $b$. These eigenvectors define a class of multiphoton squeezed states.
The structure of the uncertainty products and of the quasiprobability

states exhibit a squeezing and a deformation (cooling) of the phase--space
trajectories, both of which strongly depend on the form of the nonlinear
function. The presence of the extra nonlinear term in the phase of the wave
functions has also relevant consequences on photon statistics and correlation
properties. The non quadratic structure of the associated Hamiltonians suggests
that these states be generated in connection with multiphoton processes in

the attainment of the classical limit in terms of measurement-induced

environmentally induced disturbance at a sufficiently small value, and
examining the dynamics as the system is made more macroscopic. When the system
action is relatively small, the dynamics is quantum mechanical and when the
system action is sufficiently large there is a transition to classical
behavior. The dynamics of the rotor in the region of transition, characterized
by the late-time momentum diffusion coefficient, can be strikingly different
from both the purely quantum and classical results. Remarkably, the early time
diffusive behavior of the quantum system, even when different from its
classical counterpart, is stabilized by the continuous measurement process.
This shows that such measurements can succeed in extracting essentially quantum

theorem in particular, are also obtained when direct coupling e_q
\bar{q}\gamma_{\mu}q A^{\mu} of photon to quarks is used in place of VMD. Thus,
violation of Hara's theorem in VMD-based models does not result from the lack
of gauge invariance. It is further shown that, in the static limit of the quark
model, the CA commutator term in the p.v. amplitudes of nonleptonic hyperon
decays (NLHD) and the parity-violating \Sigma ^+ \to p \gamma decay amplitude
are proportional to each other. As a result, Hara's theorem may be satisfied in
this limit if and only if the contribution from the CA commutator in NLHD is
zero. Violation of Hara's theorem is traced back to the nonlocality of quark
model states in the static limit. It is argued that the ensuing intrinsic
baryon nonlocality does not have to be unphysical. It is stressed that the \Xi
^0 \to \Lambda \gamma asymmetry will provide very important information
concerning the presence or absence of nonlocal features in p.v. photon coupling
to baryons at vanishing photon momentum. If the \Xi ^0 \to \Lambda \gamma
asymmetry is found negative, Hara's theorem is satisfied but the
gauge-invariant quark model machinery predicting its violation must miss some
contribution, or be modified. If experiment confirms positive \Xi ^0 \to
\Lambda \gamma asymmetry, then, most likely, Hara's theorem is violated.
Although positive \Xi ^0 \to \Lambda \gamma asymmetry admits of the possibility
that Hara's theorem is satisfied, this alternative is in disagreement with
hints suggested by the similarity of photon and vector-meson couplings and the

purification. We demonstrate clearly the advantage of classical post-processing
with two-way classical communications over classical post-processing with only
one-way classical communications in QKD. This is done by the explicit
construction of a new protocol for (the error correction/detection and privacy
amplification of) BB84 that can tolerate a bit error rate of up to 18.9%, which
is higher than what any BB84 scheme with only one-way classical communications
can possibly tolerate. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of the six-state
scheme over BB84 by showing that the six-state scheme can strictly tolerate a
higher bit error rate than BB84. In particular, our six-state protocol can
tolerate a bit error rate of 26.4%, which is higher than the upper bound of 25%
bit error rate for any secure BB84 protocol. Consequently, our protocols may
allow higher key generation rate and remain secure over longer distances than
previous protocols. Our investigation suggests that two-way entanglement

the quantum structure as due to the presence of two effects, (a) a real change
of state of the system under influence of the measurement and, (b) a lack of
knowledge about a deeper deterministic reality of the measurement process. We
show that the presence of these two effects leads to the major part of the
quantum mechanical structure of a theory where the measurements contain the two
mentioned effects. We present a quantum machine, where we can illustrate in a
simple way how the quantum structure arises as a consequence of the two
effects. We introduce a parameter 'epsilon' that measures the amount of the
lack of knowledge on the measurement process, and by varying this parameter, we
describe a continuous evolution from a quantum structure (maximal lack of
knowledge) to a classical structure (zero lack of knowledge). We show that for
intermediate values of epsilon we find a new type of structure that is neither
quantum nor classical. We analyze the quantum paradoxes and show that they can
be divided into two groups: (1) The group (measurement problem and Schrodingers
cat paradox) where the paradoxical aspects arise mainly from the application of
standard quantum theory as a general theory (e.g. also describing the
measurement apparatus). This type of paradox disappears in the hidden
measurement formalism. (2) A second group collecting the paradoxes connected to
the effect of non-locality (the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and the

phenomenon that tunneling occurs even in the adiabatic limit as the nonlinear
parameter $C$ is above a critical value equal to the gap $V$ of avoided
crossing of the two levels. In this paper, we present analytical results that
give quantitative account of the breakdown of adiabaticity by mapping this
quantum nonlinear model into a classical Josephson Hamiltonian. In the critical
region, we find a power-law scaling of the nonadiabatic transition probability
as a function of $C/V-1$ and $\alpha $, the crossing rate of the energy levels.
In the subcritical regime, the transition probability still follows an
exponential law but with the exponent changed by the nonlinear effect. For

the inhomogeneous term is the trial function, and the kernel is the product of

the corresponding energy shift. By iterating this equation we obtain successive

satisfactory results for the magic numbers of clusters of divalent metals and
trivalent metals, thus indicating that Uq(3), which is a nonlinear extension of
the U(3) symmetry of the spherical (3-dimensional isotropic) harmonic

contractive channels render the states of the computer less distinguishable in

there exists a physically meaningful connection between strictly contractive
channels and errors in physically realizable quantum computers. We show that,
in the absence of error correction, sensitivity of quantum memories and
computers to strictly contractive errors grows exponentially with storage time

  Anomalously slow decoherence","A. G. Kofman","  Relaxation of a two-level system (TLS) into a resonant infinite-temperature
reservoir with a Lorentzian spectrum is studied. The reservoir is described by
a complex Gaussian-Markovian field coupled to the nondiagonal elements of the
TLS Hamiltonian. The theory can be relevant for electromagnetic interactions in
microwave high-$Q$ cavities and muon spin depolarization. Analytical results
are obtained for the strong-coupling regime, $\Omega_0\gg\nu$, where $\Omega_0$
is the rms coupling amplitude (Rabi frequency) and $\nu$ is the width of the
reservoir spectrum. In this regime, the population difference and half of the
initial coherence decay with two characteristic rates: the most part of the
decay occurs at $t\sim\Omega_0^{-1}$, the relaxation being reversible for
$t\ll(\Omega_0^2\nu)^{-1/3}$, whereas for $t\gg(\Omega_0^2\nu)^{-1/3}$ the
relaxation becomes irreversible and is practically over. The other half of the
coherence decays with the rate on the order of $\nu$, which may be slower by
orders of magnitude than the time scale of the population relaxation. The above
features are explained by the fact that at $t\ll\nu^{-1}$ the reservoir
temporal fluctuations are effectively one-dimensional (adiabatic). Moreover, we
identify the pointer basis, in which the reduction of the state vector occurs.
The pointer states are correlated with the reservoir, being dependent on the
reservoir phase.

show that for any $q,p > 1$, $\MOD_q$ is equivalent to $\MOD_p$ (up to constant

"2211","Preparation of decoherence-free, subradiant states in a cavity","Peter Foldi|Mihaly G. Benedict|Attila Czirjak","  The cause of decoherence in a quantum system can be traced back to the
interaction with the environment. As it has been pointed out first by Dicke, in
a system of N two-level atoms where each of the atoms is individually dipole
coupled to the environment, there are collective, subradiant states, that have
no dipole coupling to photon modes, and therefore they are expected to decay
slower. This property also implies that these type of states, which form an N-1
dimensional subspace of the atomic subsytem, also decohere slower. We propose a
scheme which will create such states. First the two-level atoms are placed in a
strongly detuned cavity and one of the atoms, called the control atom is
excited. The time evolution of the coupled atom-cavity system leads to an
appropriately entangled state of the atoms. By applying subsequent laser pulses
at a well defined time instant, it is possible to drive the atomic state into
the subradiant, i. e., decoherence free subspace. Up to a certain average
number of the photons, the result is independent of the state of the cavity.
The analysis of the conditions shows that this scheme is feasible with present
day techniques achieved in atom cavity interaction experiments.

lattice direction whereas the transverse confinement is much weaker. The
employed sideband cooling method, first studied by Vuletic et al.\cite{Vule98},
uses Raman transitions between Zeeman levels and produces a spin-polarized
sample. We present a detailed study of this cooling method and investigate the
role of elastic collisions in the system. We accumulate $83(5)%$ of the atoms
in the vibrational ground state of the strongly confined motion, and elastic
collisions cool the transverse motion to a temperature of $2.8 \mu $K=$0.7
\hbar\omega_{\rm osc}/k_{\rm B}$, where $\omega_{\rm osc}$ is the oscillation
frequency in the strongly confined direction. The sample then approaches the
regime of a quasi-2D cold gas. We analyze the limits of this cooling method and
propose a dynamical change of the trapping potential as a mean of cooling the
atomic sample to still lower temperatures. Measurements of the rate of
thermalization between the weakly and strongly confined degrees of freedom are
compatible with the zero energy scattering resonance observed previously in
weak 3D traps. For the explored temperature range the measurements agree with
recent calculations of quasi-2D collisions\cite{Petr01}. Transparent analytical
models reproduce the expected behavior for $k_{\rm B}T \gg \hbar \omega_{\rm

operational quantum logic"" points out that classical boolean structures are too
rigid to describe the actual and potential properties of quantum systems. On
the other hand, an intuitionistic perspective on operational quantum logic,
guides us in the direction of incorporating dynamics logically by reconsidering
the primitive propositions required to describe the behavior of a quantum
system, in particular in view of the emergent disjunctivity due to the
non-determinism of quantum measurements. A further elaboration on
""intuitionistic quantum logic"" emerges into a ""dynamic operational quantum
logic"", which allows us to express dynamic reasoning in the sense that we can
capture how actual properties propagate, including their temporal causal
structure, and provides a unified logical description of systems which evolve
or which are submitted to measurements. This setting reveals that even static
operational quantum logic bears a hidden dynamic ingredient in terms of what is
called ""the orthomodularity"" of the lattice-structure. Focusing on the quantale
semantics for dynamic operational quantum logic, we delineate some points of
difference with the existing quantale semantics for (non)-commutative linear
logic.

  and Dynamical Localization","R. Sankaranarayanan|A. Lakshminarayan|V. B. Sheorey","  The classical and quantum dynamics of a particle trapped in a one-dimensional
infinite square well with a time periodic pulsed field is investigated. This is
a two-parameter non-KAM generalization of the kicked rotor, which can be seen
as the standard map of particles subjected to both smooth and hard potentials.
The virtue of the generalization lies in the introduction of an extra parameter
R which is the ratio of two length scales, namely the well width and the field
wavelength. If R is a non-integer the dynamics is discontinuous and non-KAM. We
have explored the role of R in controlling the localization properties of the
eigenstates. In particular the connection between classical diffusion and
localization is found to generalize reasonably well. In unbounded chaotic
systems such as these, while the nearest neighbour spacing distribution of the
eigenvalues is less sensitive to the nature of the classical dynamics, the
distribution of participation ratios of the eigenstates proves to be a
sensitive measure; in the chaotic regimes the latter being lognormal. We find
that the tails of the well converged localized states are exponentially
localized despite the discontinuous dynamics while the bulk part shows
fluctuations that tend to be closer to Random Matrix Theory predictions. Time
evolving states show considerable R dependence and tuning R to enhance
classical diffusion can lead to significantly larger quantum diffusion for the
same field strengths, an effect that is potentially observable in present day
experiments.

a multiparticle setting, which was first studied by Doran, Gull and Lasenby.
The geometric interpretation of this algebra, which it inherits from its
one-particle factors, possesses a number of physically compelling features,
including simple derivations of the Pauli exclusion principle and other
nonlocal effects in quantum physics. Of particular importance here is the fact
that all the operations needed in the quantum (statistical) mechanics of spin
1/2 particles can be carried out in the ``even subalgebra'' of the MSTA. This
enables us to ``lift'' existing results in quantum information theory regarding
entanglement, decoherence and the quantum/classical transition to space-time.
The full power of the MSTA and its geometric interpretation can then be used to
obtain new insights into these foundational issues in quantum theory. A system
of spin 1/2 particles located at fixed positions in space, and interacting with
an external magnetic field and/or with one another via their intrinsic magnetic
dipoles provides a simple paradigm for the study of these issues. This paradigm
can further be easily realized and studied in the laboratory by nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

  The analogue of a least-squares quantum measurement is a tight frame that is
closest in a least-squares sense to a given set of vectors. The least-squares
tight frame is found for both the case in which the scaling of the frame is

limit of the amplitude and phase functions is analyzed by setting up a
semiclassical Ermakov system. In this limit, it is shown that classical
quantities, such as the classical probability amplitude and the reduced action,
are obtained only when the semiclassical amplitude and the accumulated phase
are non-oscillating functions respectively of the space and energy variables.
Conversely, among the infinitely many arbitrary exact quantum amplitude and
phase functions corresponding to a given wavefunction, only the non-oscillating
ones yield classical quantities in the limit $\hbar \to 0$.

quantum field theory has formed the basis for theoretical investigations in the
discipline known as random or stochastic electrodynamics (SED) wherein quantum
measurements are imitated by the introduction of a stochastic classical
background EM field. Random EM fluctuations are assumed to provide
perturbations which can mimic some quantum phenomena while retaining a purely
classical basis, e.g. the Casimir force, the Van-der-Waals force, the Lamb
shift, spontaneous emission, the RMS radius of the harmonic oscillator, and the
radius of the Bohr atom. This classical ZPF is represented as a homogeneous,
isotropic ensemble of plane waves with fixed amplitudes and random phases.
Averaging over the random phases is assumed to be equivalent to taking the
ground-state expectation values of the corresponding quantum operator. We
demonstrate that this is not precisely correct by examining the statistics of
the classical ZPF in contrast to that of the EM quantum vacuum. We derive the
distribution for the individual mode amplitudes in the ground-state as
predicted by quantum field theory (QFT) and then carry out the same calculation
for the classical ZPF analogue, showing that the distributions are only in
approximate agreement, diverging as the density of k states decreases. We
introduce an alternative classical ZPF with a different stochastic character,
and demonstrate that it can exactly reproduce the statistics of the EM vacuum
of QED. Incorporated into SED, this new field is shown to give the correct (QM)
distribution for the amplitude of the ground-state of a harmonic oscillator,
suggesting the possibility of developing further successful correspondences
between SED and QED.

space-time lattice site is encoded in a 4 state classical probability vector.
Disregarding the state occupancy, the resulting Markov process is a homogeneous
and almost isotropic binary random walk in Dirac space and Dirac time
(including Dirac time reversals). It then emerges that the Dirac wavefunction
can be identified with a polarization induced by the walk on the Dirac
space-time lattice. The model predicts that QM observation must happen in
ordinal time, and that wavefunction collapse is due not to a dynamical
discontinuity, but to selection of a particular ordinal time. Consequently, the
model is more relativistically equitable in its treatment of space and time in
that the observer is attributed no special ability to specify the Dirac time of
observation.

called quantum-nonlocality - the fact that a local realistic explanation of
quantum mechanics is not possible as quantitatively expressed by violation of
Bell's inequalities. Even as entanglement gains increasing importance in most
quantum information processing protocols, its conceptual foundation is still
widely debated. Among the open questions are: What is the conceptual meaning of
quantum entanglement? What are the most general constraints imposed by local
realism? Which general quantum states violate these constraints? Developing
Schroedinger's ideas in an information-theoretic context we suggest that a
natural understanding of quantum entanglement results when one accepts (1) that
the amount of information per elementary system is finite and (2) that the
information in a composite system resides more in the correlations than in
properties of individuals. The quantitative formulation of these ideas leads to
a rather natural criterion of quantum entanglement. Independently, extending
Bell's original ideas, we obtain a single general Bell inequality that
summarizes all possible constraints imposed by local realism on the
correlations for a multi-particle system. Violation of the general Bell
inequality results in an independent general criterion for quantum
entanglement. Most importantly, the two criteria agree in essence, though the
two approaches are conceptually very different. This concurrence strongly
supports the information-theoretic interpretation of quantum entanglement and
of quantum physics in general.

"3810","From the paradoxes of the standard wave-packet analysis to the

time problem for one particle. Our approach suggests an individual asymptotic
description of the quantum subensembles of transmitted and reflected particles
both at the final and initial stage of tunneling. We find the initial states of
both subensembles, which are non-orthogonal. The latter reflects ultimately the
fact that at the initial stage of tunneling it is impossible to predict whether
a particle will be transmitted through or reflected off the barrier. At the
same time, in this case, one can say about the to-be-transmitted and
to-be-reflected subensembles of particles. We show that before the interaction
of the incident packet with the barrier both the number of particles and the
expectation value of the particle's momentum are constant for each subensemble.
Besides, these asymptotic quantities coincide with those of the corresponding
scattered subensemble. On the basis of this formalism we define individual
delay times for both scattering channels. Taking into account the spreading of
wave packets, we define the low bound of the scattering time to describe the
whole quantum ensemble of particles. All three characteristic times are derived
in terms of the expectation values of the position and momentum operators. The
condition which must be fulfilled for completed scattering events is derived.
We propose also the scheme of a {\it gedanken} experiment that allows one to
verify our approach.

generated by the presence of fluctuations on the interactions between measuring
apparatus and physical system, we show that the quantum structure can find its
origin in the presence of these fluctuations. This appraoch, that we have
called the 'hidden measurement approach', makes it possible to construct
systems that are in between quantum and classical. We show that two of the
traditional axioms of quantum axiomatics are not satisfied for these 'in
between quantum and classical' situations, and how this structural shortcoming
of standard quantum mechanics is at the origin of most of the quantum
paradoxes. We show that in this approach the EPR paradox identifies a genuine
incompleteness of standard quantum mechanics, however not an incompleteness
that means the lacking of hidden variables, but an incompleteness pointing at
the impossibility for standard quantum mechanics to describe separated quantum
systems. We indicate in which way, by redefining the meaning of density states,

degree of belief for a single trial, without any a priori connection to

fundamental law, probabilities for individual quantum systems can be understood
within the Bayesian approach. We argue that the distinction between classical
and quantum probabilities lies not in their definition, but in the nature of
the information they encode. In the classical world, maximal information about
a physical system is complete in the sense of providing definite answers for
all possible questions that can be asked of the system. In the quantum world,
maximal information is not complete and cannot be completed. Using this
distinction, we show that any Bayesian probability assignment in quantum
mechanics must have the form of the quantum probability rule, that maximal
information about a quantum system leads to a unique quantum-state assignment,
and that quantum theory provides a stronger connection between probability and
measured frequency than can be justified classically. Finally we give a
Bayesian formulation of quantum-state tomography.

multiple scattering of light by a disordered sample of thermal atoms,
interference effects are usually washed out by the fast atomic motion. This is
no longer true for cold atoms where CBS has recently been observed. However,
the internal structure of the atoms strongly influences the interference

transition with arbitrary degeneracy and study its impact on coherent
backscattering. We show that the interference contrast is strongly reduced.
Assuming a uniform statistical distribution over internal degrees of freedom,
we compute analytically the single and double scattering contributions to the
intensity in the weak localization regime. The so-called ladder and crossed
diagrams are generalized to the case of atoms and permit to calculate
enhancement factors and backscattering intensity profiles for polarized light

by expanding the vector potential in terms of non-Hermitean (Fox-Li) modes in
both the cavity and external regions. The cavity non-Hermitean modes (NHM) are
treated using the paraxial and monochromaticity approximations. The NHM
bi-orthogonality relationships are used in a standard canonical quantization
procedure based on introducing generalised coordinates and momenta for the
electromagnetic (EM) field. The quantum EM field is equivalent to a set of
quantum harmonic oscillators (QHO), associated with either the cavity or the
external region NHM. This confirms the validity of the photon model in unstable
optical systems, though the annihilation and creation operators for each QHO
are not Hermitean adjoints. The quantum Hamiltonian for the EM field is the sum
of non-commuting cavity and external region contributions, each of which is sum
of independent QHO Hamiltonians for each NHM, but the external field
Hamiltonian also includes a coupling term responsible for external NHM photon
exchange processes. Cavity energy gain and loss processes is associated with
the non-commutativity of cavity and external region operators, given in terms
of surface integrals involving cavity and external region NHM functions on the
cavity-external region boundary. The spontaneous decay of a two-level atom
inside an unstable cavity is treated using the essential states approach and

photon absorption have a different coupling constant to those leading to photon

completely different from so-called hidden parameter models, namely, we start
from a certain variant of QM - deterministic QM - which has most features
similar to QM, but the evolution in this theory is deterministic. Then we
introduce the subquantum medium composed of so-called space-like objects. The
interaction of a deterministic QM-particle with this medium is represented by
the random force, but it is the random force governed by the probability
amplitude distribution. This is the quantum random force and it is very
different from classical random force. This implies that in our models there
are no Bell`s inequalities and that our models (depending on a certain
parameter tau) can be arbitrarily close to QM. The parameter tau defines a
relaxation time and on time intervals shorter than tau, the evolution violates
Heisenberg`s uncertainty principle and it is almost deterministic - spreading
of the wave packet is much slower than in QM. Such type of short-time effects
form the bases of proposed tests, which can, in principle, define limits of
validity of QM. The proposed experiments are related to the behavior of quantum
objects on short time intervals, where we expect the behavior different from
QM. The main proposed feature is violation of uncertainty relations on short

probability of correctly estimating Alice's commitment and Alice's probability
of successfully unveiling whatever bit she desires. In this paper, we seek to
determine these bounds for generalizations of the BB84 bit commitment protocol.
In such protocols, an honest Alice commits to a bit by randomly choosing a
state from a specified set and submitting this to Bob, and later unveils the
bit to Bob by announcing the chosen state, at which point Bob measures the
projector onto the state. Bob's optimal cheating strategy can be easily deduced
from well known results in the theory of quantum state estimation. We show how
to understand Alice's most general cheating strategy, (which involves her
submitting to Bob one half of an entangled state) in terms of a theorem of
Hughston, Jozsa and Wootters. We also show how the problem of optimizing
Alice's cheating strategy for a fixed submitted state can be mapped onto a
problem of state estimation. Finally, using the Bloch ball representation of
qubit states, we identify the optimal coherent attack for a class of protocols
that can be implemented with just a single qubit. These results provide a tight
upper bound on Alice's probability of successfully unveiling whatever bit she
desires in the protocol proposed by Aharonov et al., and lead us to identify a

the quantum mechanical paradoxes are due to structural shortcomings of the
standard quantum theory, which means that our analysis agrees with the claim

the absence of hidden variables but to the impossibility for standard quantum

"3511","Is quantum decoherence reality or appearance?","F. Herbut","  It has been experimentally demonstrated that quantum coherence can persist in
macroscopic phenomena [J.R. Friedman et al.,Nature, 406 (2000) 43]. To face the
challenge of this new fact, in this article QM in its standard form is assumed
to be extended by one beable (hidden variable), i. e., a quantum observable
with always definite values in nature (but usually only statistically given in
the quantum state). Localization is taken as the most plausible beable. The
paradoxical aspects of conventional QM take now a different form. Suitably
defining the notion of ""subject"" fully within the QM formalism, proving the
quantum conditional subsystem-state theorem, and choosing the
relative-decoherence interpretation of QM, the paradoxes formally disappear,
leaving one with decoherence relative to the definite values of the beable;
thus being only appearance, not absolute reality in QM. Relative to a different
subject one has perseverance of coherence. Hence, in this approach it is
claimed that decoherence and coherence, both exist in reality, but are not
""seen"" by the same subject, and ""subject"" is, in this interpretation,
indispensable. The two mentioned, apparently contradictory phenomena, are in
this way decoupled from each other, contradiction is avoided, and any one of
the two can be treated in the way that is usual in QM.

that a unique (""crisp"") trajectory of a classical particle emerges out of a

  system","Evgueni V. Kovarski","  In view of a three-dimensional picture (3D) of probability to find a particle
at a plane of the frequency and the time (PTF) becomes that process of
absorption and process of radiation for two - level system have different
direction on the time. Both processes are in the past or in the future
depending on named transition due to reversible model of the two-level atom.
The opportunity to know the last history of the resonant event for the
absorption process is for quantum interference interaction or for the resonant
radiation. On the contrary, to predict the resonant event in the future is
possible only by use near resonant atom-field absorption or by use radiation at
a fixed time. The problem of life time for a particle is entered through time
of spontaneous radiation connected with trajectory of the quantum transition.
It is offered to connect a trajectory of a particle during quantum transitions
with distribution of probability to find a particle. The conception of the
spectral history for events due to probability distribution is introduced for
next discussion.

Finally, a phase-conjugated inputs $(N,N')$-to-$(M,M')$ continuous cloner is

entropic measures are compared with a conventional phase distribution from the
Husimi Q-function. Compact-form formulae for the entropic measures are found

remotely with a non-trivial protocol: Arbitrary rotations around a fixed

direction lying in a plane orthogonal to $\vec{n}$. The overall classical
information and distributed entanglement cost required for the remote
implementation depends on whether it is a priori known to which of the two
teleportable subsets the transformation belongs to. If it is so, the optimal
protocol consumes one e-bit of entanglement and one c-bit in each direction. If
the subset is not known, two e-bits of entanglement need to be consumed while
the classical channel becomes asymmetric, two c-bits are conveyed from Alice to
Bob but only one from Bob to Alice.

to novel consequences. In the high temperature limit, there is a drastic
reduction in the degrees of freedom, of the type found, for example, in strings
far above the Hagedorn temperature. In view of this, the present GUP may
perhaps be taken as the new version of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
conjectured by Atick and Witten to be responsible for such reduction. Also, the
present GUP leads naturally to varying speed of light and modified dispersion
relations. They are likely to have novel implications for cosmology and black

from 0 to 4.414x10^13 G and orientations of the molecular axis with respect to

dependent vector potential is used in the Hamiltonian, which is finally
variationally optimized. A well pronounced minimum on the total energy surface
of the (ppe) system in both 1g and 1u states is found for all magnetic fields

configuration (theta=0) at equilibrium always corresponds to the minimal total
energy. It is found that for a given theta for both states the magnetic field
growth is always accompanied by an increase in the total and binding energies

Using a photon as a quantum bit (qubit) is one of the most promising ways to
realize a universal quantum computer because the coherent superposition state
of a photon is very robust against various sources of decoherence. However, it
is too difficult to realize two-qubit (photon) gates because it requires huge
nonlinearity between photons. Here we show the realization of a controlled-NOT
(CNOT) gate, the most important and elemental two-qubit gate for quantum
computation, by extending our previous research. The heart of our experiment is
the conditional measurement of two-photon coincidences in the Franson-type
experiment[7]. The photon counting measurement plays the same role as the
nonlinearity required for the two-qubit gate, and our system reproduces the
truth table of the CNOT gate. Furthermore, we create an entangled state from
the superposition state by our gate, which is clear evidence that our gate
works as a quantum logic gate. Our results make it possible to manipulate the
quantum state of photons including entanglement and represent significant
progress in the operation of various algorithms in quantum computation.

neither states of Nature nor states of knowledge. The real issue is not the

sufficiently large throughput value. The standard result of generalized privacy
amplification yields an upper bound only on the average value of the mutual
information available to an eavesdropper. Unfortunately this result by itself
is inadequate for cryptographic applications. A naive application of the
standard result leads one to incorrectly conclude that an acceptable upper
bound on the mutual information has been achieved. It is the pointwise value of
the bound on the mutual information, associated with the use of some specific
hash function, that corresponds to actual implementations. We provide a fully
rigorous mathematical derivation that shows how to obtain a cryptographically
acceptable upper bound on the actual, pointwise value of the mutual
information. Unlike the bound on the average mutual information, the value of
the upper bound on the pointwise mutual information and the number of bits by
which the secret key is compressed are specified by two different parameters,
and the actual realization of the bound in the pointwise case is necessarily
associated with a specific failure probability. The constraints amongst these
parameters, and the effect of their values on the system throughput, have not

inequality establishing the upper bound on the modulus of difference between
probability distributions generated by two any states for an arbitrary
measurement. The tightest lower bound on the relative error is then obtained.
Hillery and Buzek originally examined an approximate state-dependent copying
and obtained the lower bound on the absolute error. We consider relationship
between the size of error and the corresponding probability distributions and
obtain the tightest lower bound on the absolute error. Thus, the proposed

electron spin in a quantum dot or a similar nanostructure. Our main result is
the exact cancellation of the spin-orbit effects in the sequence producing the
quantum XOR gate for the ideal case where the pulse shapes of the exchange and
spin-orbit interactions are identical. For the non-ideal case, the two pulse

However, correlation between subsystems can be present from purely non-quantum

  formalism","Adam Miranowicz|Wieslaw Leonski|Nobuyuki Imoto","  The interest in quantum-optical states confined in finite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces has recently been stimulated by the progress in quantum computing,
quantum-optical state preparation, and measurement techniques, in particular,
by the development of the discrete quantum-state tomography. In the first part
of our review we present two essentially different approaches to define
harmonic oscillator states in the finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. One of
them is related to the truncation scheme of Pegg, Phillips and Barnett [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 81, 1604 (1998)] -- the so-called quantum scissors device. The
second method corresponds to the truncation scheme of Leo\'nski and Tana\'s
[Phys. Rev. A 49, R20 (1994)]. We propose some new definitions of the states
related to these truncation schemes and find their explicit forms in the Fock
representation. We discuss finite-dimensional generalizations of coherent
states, phase coherent states, displaced number states, Schr\""odinger cats, and
squeezed vacuum. We show some intriguing properties of the states with the help
of the discrete Wigner function.

quantum mechanics. They act unitarily on the quantum phase space and generate
$\hbar$-independent quantum canonical maps. It is shown that such maps act in
the noncommutative phase space as dictated by the classical covariance. A
crucial observation made is that under the classical covariance the local
quantum mechanical picture can become nonlocal in the Hilbert space. This
nonlocal picture is made equivalent by the Weyl map to a noncommutative picture
in the phase space formulation of the theory. The connection between the
entanglement and nonlocality of the representation is explored and specific
examples of the generation of entanglement are provided by using such concepts
as the generalized Bell states. That the results have direct application in
generating vacuum soliton configurations in the recently popular scalar field
theories of noncommutative coordinates is also demonstrated.

squeezing, in which the variances of one or more Stokes parameters are smaller

of these concepts to bright squeezed light. It is shown that a light beam
formed by interference of two orthogonally-polarized quadrature-squeezed beams

polarization-squeezed beam through suitable optical components generates a pair
of polarization-entangled light beams with the nature of a two-mode squeezed
state. The use of pairs of primary polarization-squeezed light beams leads to
substantially increased entanglement and to the generation of EPR-entangled

reduction -- between quantum one-way functions and quantum hard-predicates --
is quantitatively more efficient than the known classical version. Roughly
speaking, if the one-way function acts on n-bit strings then the overhead in
the reduction is by a factor of O(n/epsilon^2) in the classical case but only
by a factor of O(1/epsilon) in the quantum case, where 1/2 + epsilon is the
probability of predicting the hard-predicate. Moreover, we prove via a lower
bound that, in a black-box framework, the classical version of the reduction
cannot have overhead less than order n/epsilon^2.
  We also show that, using this reduction, a quantum bit commitment scheme that
is perfectly binding and computationally concealing can be obtained from any

  measurements is not influenced by test-mass quantization","Vladimir B. Braginsky|Mikhail L. Gorodetsky|Farid Ya. Khalili|Andrey B. Matsko|Kip S. Thorne|Sergey P. Vyatchanin","  It is shown that photon shot noise and radiation-pressure back-action noise
are the sole forms of quantum noise in interferometric gravitational wave
detectors that operate near or below the standard quantum limit, if one filters
the interferometer output appropriately. No additional noise arises from the
test masses' initial quantum state or from reduction of the test-mass state due
to measurement of the interferometer output or from the uncertainty principle
associated with the test-mass state. Two features of interferometers are
central to these conclusions: (i) The interferometer output (the photon number
flux N(t) entering the final photodetector) commutes with itself at different
times in the Heisenberg Picture, [N(t), N(t')] = 0, and thus can be regarded as
classical. (ii) This number flux is linear in the test-mass initial position
and momentum operators x_o and p_o, and those operators influence the measured
photon flux N(t) in manners that can easily be removed by filtering -- e.g., in
most interferometers, by discarding data near the test masses' 1 Hz swinging
freqency. The test-mass operators x_o and p_o contained in the unfiltered
output N(t) make a nonzero contribution to the commutator [N(t), N(t')]. That
contribution is cancelled by a nonzero commutation of the photon shot noise and
radiation-pressure noise, which also are contained in N(t). This cancellation
of commutators is responsible for the fact that it is possible to derive an
interferometer's standard quantum limit from test-mass considerations, and
independently from photon-noise considerations. These conclusions are true for
a far wider class of measurements than just gravitational-wave interferometers.
To elucidate them, this paper presents a series of idealized thought
experiments that are free from the complexities of real measuring systems.

starting point for the semi-classical operational approach by Noh, Fougeres and
Mandel (NFM) to the old and notorious phase problem in quantum optics.
Following a recent group theoretical quantization of the symplectic space S =
{(phi in R mod 2pi, p > 0)} in terms of irreducible unitary representations of
the group SO(1,2) the present paper applies those results to that controversial
problem of quantizing moduli and phases of complex numbers: The Poisson
brackets of the classical observables p cos\phi, -p sin\phi and p > 0 form the
Lie algebra of the group SO(1,2). The corresponding self-adjoint generators
K_1, K_2 and K_3 of that group may be obtained from its irreducible unitary
representations. For the positive discrete series the modulus operator K_3 has
the spectrum {k+n, n = 0, 1,2,...; k > 0}. Self-adjoint operators for cos phi

The approach advocated here solves, e.g. the modulus-phase quantization problem

quantum mechanics. The wave-particle duality makes it impossible to tell which

a Young's double-slit experiment. In this paper, this duality is appraised

used to detect the which-path information of each atom while uphold the

"190","How unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment is possible","H. P. Yuen","  Bit commitment involves the submission of evidence from one party to another
so that the evidence can be used to confirm a later revealed bit value by the
first party, while the second party cannot determine the bit value from the
evidence alone. It is widely believed that unconditionally secure quantum bit
commitment is impossible due to quantum entanglement cheating, which is
codified in a general impossibility theorem. In this paper, the scope of this
general impossibility proof is analyzed, and gaps are found. Two variants of a
bit commitment scheme utilizing anonymous quantum states and decoy states are
presented. In the first variant, the exact verifying measurement is independent
of the committed bit value, thus the second party can make it before the first
party opens, making possible an unconditional security proof based on
no-cloning. In the second variant, the impossibility proof fails because
quantum entanglement purification of a mixed state does not render the protocol
determinate. Whether impossibility holds in this or similar protocols is an
open question, although preliminary results already show that the impossibility
proof cannot work as it stands.

multipartite mixed states, which are independent of their eigenvalues and only
measure the ""position"" of their eigenvectors, as their non-local invariants
(ie. remaining invariant after local untary transformations). These invariants
are naturally arised from the physical consideration of checking multipartite
mixed states by measuring them with multipartite separable pure states. The
algebraic sets have to be the sum of linear subspaces if the multipartite mixed
state is separable, and thus we give a new separability criterion of
multipartite mixed states. A continuous family of 4-party mixed states, whose
members are separable for any 2:2 cut and entangled for any 1:3 cut (thus bound
entanglement if 4 parties are isolated), is constructed and studied from our
invariants and separability criterion. Examples of LOCC-incomparable entangled
tripartite pure states are given to show it is hopeless to characterize the
entanglement properties of tripartite pure states by only using the eigenvalue
speactra of their partial traces. We also prove that at least $n^2+n-1$ terms

write a generic pure state in $H_A^{n^2} \otimes H_B^{n^2} \otimes H_C^{n^2}$

"3715","Yet another resolution of the Gibbs paradox: an information theory
  approach","Chih-Yuan Tseng|Ariel Caticha","  The ``Gibbs Paradox'' refers to several related questions concerning entropy
in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics: whether it is an extensive
quantity or not, how it changes when identical particles are mixed, and the
proper way to count states in systems of identical particles. Several authors
have recognized that the paradox is resolved once it is realized that there is
no such thing as the entropy of a system, that there are many entropies, and
that the choice between treating particles as being distinguishable or not
depends on the resolution of the experiment. The purpose of this note is
essentially pedagogical; we add to their analysis by examining the paradox from
the point of view of information theory. Our argument is based on that
`grouping' property of entropy that Shannon recognized, by including it among
his axioms, as an essential requirement on any measure of information. Not only
does it provide the right connection between different entropies but, in
addition, it draws our attention to the obvious fact that addressing issues of
distinguishability and of counting states requires a clear idea about what
precisely do we mean by a state.

theory. Detailed predictions are made for the dependence of the lattice Kondo
resonance and the conduction electron spectral density on temperature and band
filling $n_{c}$. Two low-energy scales are identified in the spectra: a
renormalized hybridization pseudogap scale $T^{*}$, which correlates with the
single-ion Kondo scale, and a lattice Kondo scale $T_{0} < T^{*}$, which acts
as the Fermi-liquid coherence scale. The lattice Kondo resonance is split into
a main branch, which is pinned at the Fermi level, and whose width is set by
$T_{0}$, and an upper branch at $\omega\approx T^{*}$. The weight of the upper
branch decreases rapidly away from $n_{c}=1$ and vanishes for $n_{c}\lesssim
0.7$. In contrast, the pseudogap in the conduction electron spectral density
persists for all $n_{c}$. On increasing temperature, the lattice Kondo
resonance at the Fermi level vanishes on a temperature scale of order $10
T_{0}$, as in impurity model calculations. In contrast to impurity model
spectra, however, the position of the lattice Kondo resonance depends strongly
on temperature, particularly close to the Kondo insulating state. The results
are used to make predictions on the temperature dependence of the low-energy
photoemission and inverse photoemission spectra of metallic heavy fermions and
doped Kondo insulators. We compare our results with available high-resolution
measurements on YbInCu$_4$ and YbAgCu$_4$. The loss in intensity with
increasing temperature, and the asymmetric lineshape of the low-energy spectra
are well accounted for by our model. More detailed agreement with experiment

"4915","Quantum stochastic approach to the description of quantum measurements","Elena R. Loubenets","  In the present paper we consider the problem of description of an arbitrary
generalized quantum measurement with outcomes in a measurable space. Analyzing
the unitary invariants of a measuring process, we present the most general form
of a possible integral representation of an instrument, which differs from the
representations of an instrument available in the mathematical and physical
literature. We introduce the notion of a quantum stochastic representation of
an instrument, whose elements are wholly determined by the unitary invariants
of a measuring process. We show that the description of a generalized direct
quantum measurement can be considered in the frame of a new general approach,
which we call the quantum stochastic approach (QSA), based on the notion of a
family of quantum stochastic evolution operators, satisfying the orthonormality
relation and describing the conditional evolution of a quantum system under a
measurement. The QSA allows to give: a) the complete statistical description of
any generalized direct quantum measurement (a POV measure and a family of
posterior states); b) the complete description in a Hilbert space of the
stochastic behaviour of a quantum system under a measurement in the sense of
specification of the probabilistic transition law governing the change from the
initial state of a quantum system to a final one under a single measurement; c)
to formalize the consideration of all possible types of quantum measurements.
For measurements continuous in time the QSA allows, in particular, to define in
the most general case (without assuming any Markov property) the notion of
posterior pure state trajectories (quantum trajectories) and to give their
probabilistic treatment.

perturbations provides a physical process where the effective classicality of

produced during inflation, this range of scales corresponds to PBH with masses
$M\ll 10^{15}$ g. For PBH with masses $M\sim M_H(t_e)$, the horizon mass at the

detector based on the radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rf-SET).
Using the noise analysis of a SET by Korotkov as our starting point, we
determine the spectral density of the displacement noise due to the tunneling
current shot noise. The resulting mechanical displacement noise decreases in
inverse proportion to the increasing gate voltage. In contrast, the
displacement noise due to the fluctuating SET island charge increases
approximately linearly with increasing gate voltage. Taking into account both
of these noise sources results in an optimum gate voltage value for the lowest
displacement noise and hence best sensitivity. We show that a displacement
sensitivity of about 10^-4 Angstroms and a force sensitivity of about 10^-16 N
are predicted for a micron-sized cantilever with a realizable resonant
frequency 100 MHz and quality factor Q~10^4. Such sensitivities would allow the
detection of quantum squeezing in the mechanical motion of the micro-mechanical
cantilever and the detection of single-spin magnetic resonance in magnetic

physical wave functions. They are also basis vectors that expand any physical
wave function in a Dirac basis vector expansion. It is shown that an acceptable
physical wave function must fulfill stronger conditions than just square
integrability--the space of physical wave functions is not the whole Hilbert

realisable operations that realise as closely as possible certain desired
transformations between quantum states, e.g. quantum cloning, teleportation,
quantum gates, etc. Mathematically, this problem boils down to finding a
completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) linear map that maximizes the
(mean) fidelity between the map itself and the desired transformation. In this
note we want to draw attention to the fact that this problem belongs to the
class of so-called semidefinite programming (SDP) problems. As SDP problems are
convex, it immediately follows that they do not suffer from local optima.
Furthermore, this implies that the numerical optimization of the CPTP map can,
and should, be done using methods from the well-established SDP field, as these
methods exploit convexity and are guaranteed to converge to the real solution.
Finally, we show how the duality inherent to convex and SDP problems can be
exploited to prove analytically the optimality of a proposed solution. We give
an example of how to apply this proof method by proving the optimality of Hardy
and Song's proposed solution for the universal qubit $\theta$-shifter

presented, based on the subdynamical kinetic equation (SKE) for an open quantum
system. The eigenvectors of the kinetic equation are shown to remain invariant
before and after interaction with the environment. However, the eigenvalues in
the projected subspace exhibit a type of phase shift to the evolutionary
states. This phase shift does not destroy the decoherence-free (DF) property of
the subspace because the associated fidelity is 1. This permits a universal
formalism to be presented - the eigenprojectors of the free part of the
Hamiltonian for the system and bath may be used to construct a DF projected
subspace based on the SKE. To eliminate possible phase or unitary errors
induced by the change in the eigenvalues, a cancellation technique is proposed,
using the adjustment of the coupling time, and applied to a two qubit computing
system. A general criteria for constructing a DF projected subspace from the
SKE is discussed. Finally, a proposal for using triangulation to realize a

rather than metrics as compared to in original version due to Arnowitt, Deser
and Misner. Canonical quantum general relativity is an attempt to define a
mathematically rigorous, non-perturbative, background independent theory of
Lorentzian quantum gravity in four spacetime dimensions in the continuum. The
approach is minimal in that one simply analyzes the logical consequences of
combining the principles of general relativity with the principles of quantum
mechanics. The requirement to preserve background independence has lead to new,
fascinating mathematical structures which one does not see in perturbative
approaches, e.g. a fundamental discreteness of spacetime seems to be a
prediction of the theory providing a first substantial evidence for a theory in
which the gravitational field acts as a natural UV cut-off. An effort has been
made to provide a self-contained exposition of a restricted amount of material
at the appropriate level of rigour which at the same time is accessible to
graduate students with only basic knowledge of general relativity and quantum
field theory on Minkowski space.

suffers \sigma_{z} error with probability p (0\leq p\leq 1) independently at
every step in the algorithm. Considering an n-qubit density operator to which
Grover's operation is applied M times, we expand it in powers of 2Mnp and
derive its matrix element order by order under the n\to \infty limit. (In this
large n limit, we assume p is small enough, so that 2Mnp(\geq 0) can take any
real positive value or 0.) This approach gives us an interpretation about
creation of new modes caused by \sigma_{z} error and an asymptotic form of an
arbitrary order correction. Calculating the matrix element up to the fifth
order term numerically, we investigate a region of 2Mnp (perturbative
parameter) where the algorithm finds the correct item with a threshold of
probability P_{th} or more. It satisfies 2Mnp<(8/5)(1-P_{th}) around 2Mnp\simeq
0 and P_{th}\simeq 1, and this linear relation is applied to a wide range of
P_{th} approximately. This observation is similar to a result obtained by E.

in the famous paper of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [18]. Recently it has been
realized that quantum entanglement is a key ingredient in quantum computation,
quantum communication and quantum cryptography ([16],[17],[6]). In this paper,
we introduce algebraic sets, which are determinantal varieties in the complex
projective spaces or the products of complex projective spaces, for the mixed
states in bipartite or multipartite quantum systems as their invariants under
local unitary transformations. These invariants are naturally arised from the
physical consideration of measuring mixed states by separable pure states. In
this way algebraic geometry and complex differential geometry of these
algebraic sets turn to be powerful tools for the understanding of quantum
enatanglement. Our construction has applications in the following important
topics in quantum information theory: 1) separability criterion, it is proved
the algebraic sets have to be the sum of the linear subspaces if the mixed
states are separable; 2) lower bound of Schmidt numbers, that is, generic low
rank bipartite mixed states are entangled in many degrees of freedom; 3)
simulation of Hamiltonians, it is proved the simulation of semi-positive
Hamiltonians of the same rank implies the projective isomorphisms of the
corresponding algebraic sets; 4) construction of bound enatanglement, examples
of the entangled mixed states which are invariant under partial transpositions
(thus PPT bound entanglement) are constructed systematically from our new
separability criterion. On the other hand many examples of entangled mixed
states with rich algebraic-geometric structure in their associated
determinantal varieties are constructed and studied from this point of view.

counterpart in quantum mechanics. In view of these developments we propose
""dequantisation"", a mechanism to render a quantum theory classical.
Specifically, we present a geometric procedure to ""dequantise"" a given quantum
mechanics (regardless of its classical origin, if any) to possibly different
classical limits, whose quantisation gives back the original quantum theory.
The standard classical limit $\hbar\to 0$ arises as a particular case of our
approach.

applications for other sets of coherent states arose, the rules of definition

done away with the group connections altogether and thereby allowed sets of

to perform a quantum mechanical measurement in an incomplete basis. This
happens because the measurement projects the particle into a lower dimensional

nonlocal transmission of a bit without concomitant causal communication.

absorbed pre-adjacent vacuum is emitted to become the added space for the

the three different types of vacuum: the adjacent vacuum, the adjacent zero
space, and the empty space. The absorption of the adjacent vacuum results in

vacuum can be anywhere instantly in the empty space superimposed with the
adjacent zero space where any point can be the starting point (zero point) of

whether the energy belongs to the discrete or to the continuous part of the

"2518","Substituting a qubit for an arbitrarily large number of classical bits","Ernesto F. Galvao|Lucien Hardy","  We show that a qubit can be used to substitute for an arbitrarily large
number of classical bits. We consider a physical system S interacting locally
with a classical field phi(x) as it travels directly from point A to point B.
The field has the property that its integrated value is an integer multiple of
some constant. The problem is to determine whether the integer is odd or even.
This task can be performed perfectly if S is a qubit. On the otherhand, if S is
a classical system then we show that it must carry an arbitrarily large amount
of classical information. We identify the physical reason for such a huge
quantum advantage, and show that it also implies a large difference between the
size of quantum and classical memories necessary for some computations. We also
present a simple proof that no finite amount of one-way classical communication
can perfectly simulate the effect of quantum entanglement.

dimensionless parameter is N=P/\hbar\omega\kappa, the number of photons per

coherent beams and cw (broadband) squeezed beams are considered. For a coherent
beam a simple feedback scheme gives good results, with a phase variance \simeq
N^{-1/2}/2. This is \sqrt{2} times smaller than that achievable by nonadaptive

states in laser-driven atoms with either a magnetic field or modulated laser

this optimum value. These results are illustrated with detailed examples of
destabilizing dark states in some commonly-trapped ions and supported by
insights derived from numerical calculations and simple theoretical models.

"6318","Geometric Quantum Computation on Solid-State Qubits","Mahn-Soo Choi","  An adiabatic cyclic evolution of control parameters of a quantum system ends
up with a holonomic operation on the system, determined entirely by the
geometry in the parameter space. The operation is given either by a simple
phase factor (a Berry phase) or a non-Abelian unitary operator depending on the
degeneracy of the eigenspace of the Hamiltonian. Geometric quantum computation
is a scheme to use such holonomic operations rather than the conventional
dynamic operations to manipulate quantum states for quantum information
processing. Here we propose a geometric quantum computation scheme which can be
realized with current technology on nanoscale Josephson-junction networks,
known as a promising candidate for solid-state quantum computer.

F has recently been evaluated for the special case of metals (refractive index

statistical mechanics. The Debye expansions for the Riccati-Bessel functions
when carried out to a high order are found to be very useful in practice

accurate results even for the lowest values of l. Another virtue of the Debye
expansions is that the limiting case of metals becomes quite amenable to an
analytical treatment in spherical geometry. We first discuss the zero-frequency
TE mode problem from a mathematical viewpoint and then, as physical input,
invoke the actual dispersion relations. The result of our analysis, based upon
adoption of the Drude dispersion relation as the most correct one at low

integrated time auto-correlation function of the generator of perturbation.
Surprisingly, this relation predicts the slower decay of fidelity the faster
decay of correlations is. In particular, for non-ergodic and non-mixing
dynamics, where asymptotic decay of correlations is absent, a qualitatively
different and faster decay of fidelity is predicted on a time scale 1/delta as
opposed to mixing dynamics where the fidelity is found to decay exponentially
on a time-scale 1/delta^2, where delta is a strength of perturbation. A
detailed discussion of a semi-classical regime of small effective values of
Planck constant is given where classical correlation functions can be used to
predict quantum fidelity decay. Note that the correct and intuitively expected
classical stability behavior is recovered in the classical limit hbar->0, as

simplest notion of structural completely positive approximation (SCPA) and
structural physical approximations (SPA) of unphysical map are introduced. Both
always exist for linear hermitian maps and can be optimised under natural
assumptions. However it is shown that some intuitively natural SPA of the
nonlinear operation $\varrho^{\otimes 2} \to \varrho^{2}$ that was already
proven to be unphysical is impossible. It is conjectured that there exist no
SPA of the operation $\varrho^{\otimes n} \to \varrho^{n}$ at all. It is
pointed out that, on the other hand, it is physically possible to measure the
trace of the second power of the state $Tr(\varrho^{2})$ if only two copies of
the system are available. This gives the interpretation of one of Tsallis
entropy as mean value of some ``multicopy'' observable. The (partial)
generalisation of this idea shows that each of higher order Tsallis entropies
can be measured with help of only two multicopy observables. Following this
observations the notion of multicopy entanglement witnesses is defined and
first example is provided. Finally, with help of multicopy observables simple

associated with electric dipole active (magnetic dipole active) BECs in a
vortex state are evaluated for an infinite- and a finite-length cylindrical
BEC. The predictd monopole charge distributions, both electric and magnetic,
automatically satisfy the requirement of global charge neutrality and the

equations for Fermi liquids far from equilibrium. The emphasis is on the
consistent treatment of the off-shell motion between collisions and on the
non-instant and non-local picture of binary collisions. The resulting kinetic
equation is of the Boltzmann type, and it represents an interpolation between
the theory of transport in metals and the theory of moderately dense gases. The
free motion of particles is renormalised by various mean field and mass
corrections in the spirit of Landau's quasiparticles in metals. The collisions
are non-local in the spirit of Enskog's theory of non-ideal gases. The
collisions are moreover non-instant, a feature which is absent in the theory of
gases, but which is shown to be important for dense Fermi systems. In spite of
its formal complexity, the presented theory has a simple implementation within
the Monte-Carlo simulation schemes. Applications in nuclear physics are given
for heavy-ion reactions and the results are compared with the former theory and
recent experimental data. The effect of the off-shell motion and the non-local
and non-instant collisions on the dynamics of the system can be characterised

tensor. Non-equilibrium counterparts of these functions and the corresponding

observables are real functions taking an exact outcome on every (pure) state;
in a quantum theory, at the contrary, a given observable on a given state can
take several values with only a predictable probability. However, even in the
classical case, when an observer is intrinsically unable to distinguish between
some distinct states he can convince himself that the measure of its
''observables'' can have several values in a random way with a statistical
character. What kind of statistical theory is obtainable in this way? It is
possible, for example, to obtain exactly the statistical previsions of quantum
mechanics? Or, in other words, can a physical system showing a classical
behaviour appear to be a quantum system to a confusing observer? We show that
from a mathematical viewpoint it is not difficult to produce a theory with
hidden variables having this property. We don't even try to justify in physical
terms the artificial construction we propose; what we do is to give a general
and rigorous argument showing how the interplay between the classical and
quantum mechanics we offer is interpretable as the difference between an
imaginary very expert observer and another nonexpert observer. This proves also
that besides the well known theorems concerning the impossibility of hidden
variables (cfr. Von Neumann [Neu] and Jauch-Piron [J-P]) there is also room for
a result in favor of the possibility.

a lack of knowledge about a deeper deterministic reality of the measurement
process. We present a quantum machine, where we can illustrate in a simple way
how the quantum structure arises as a consequence of the two mentioned effects.
We introduce a parameter epsilon that measures the size of the lack of
knowledge on the measurement process, and by varying this parameter, we
describe a continuous evolution from a quantum structure (maximal lack of
knowledge) to a classical structure (zero lack of knowledge). We show that for
intermediate values of epsilon we find a new type of structure, that is neither
quantum nor classical. We apply the model that we have introduced to situations
of lack of knowledge about the measurement process appearing in other regions
of reality. More specifically we investigate the quantum-like structures that
appear in the situation of psychological decision processes, where the subject
is influenced during the testing, and forms some of his opinions during the

quantum probabilities are epistemic and not ontological, which means that

based on using an unconditionally secure ``quantum channel'' to share a secret

use a (semi-)classical channel instead of the quantum channel, which would
remove the supposedly unconditional security. One example is the BB84 protocol,
where the quantum channel can be implemented in polarization of single photons.
Here, use of several photons instead of one to encode each bit of the key
provides a similar but insecure system. For protocols based on violation of a
Bell inequality (e.g., the Ekert protocol) the situation is somewhat different.
While the possibility is mentioned by some authors, it is generally thought
that an implementation of a (semi-)classical channel will differ significantly

identical physical setup as is used in photon-polarization Ekert QKD. Since the
physical implementation is identical, a manufacturer may include this

`quantum implicative connective', has a fundamental dynamic nature and encodes
the so-called `causal duality' (Coecke, Moore and Stubbe 2001;
quant-ph/0009100) for the particular case of a quantum measurement with a
projector as corresponding self-adjoint operator. In particular: The action of
the Sasaki hook $(a\stackrel{S}{\to}-)$ for fixed antecedent $a$ assigns to
some property ``the weakest cause before the measurement of actuality of that
property after the measurement'', i.e. ${(a\stackrel{S}{\to}b)}$ is the weakest
property that guarantees actuality of $b$ after performing the measurement
represented by the projector that has the `subspace $a$' as eigenstates for
eigenvalue 1, say, the measurement that `tests' $a$ . From this we conclude
that the logicality attributable to quantum systems contains a fundamentally
dynamic ingredient: Causal duality actually provides a new dynamic

from a binary connective implication to a ternary connective where two of the

experimentally as statistical samplings, are described theoretically by means
of linear integral transforms of quantum probability density and current, from
intrinsic into recorded readings. Accordingly, the quantum observables appear
as random variables, valuable, in both readings, through probabilistic
numerical parameters (characteristics). The measurements uncertainties (errors)
are described by means of the intrinsic-recorded changes for the alluded
parameters or for the informational entropies. The present approach, together
with other author's investigations, give a natural and unified reconsideration
of primary problems of Heisenberg's relations and quantum measurements. The

infrastructure of the powerful Si technology. Quantitative understanding of and
precise physical control over donor (e.g. Phosphorus) exchange are crucial
elements in the physics underlying the proposed Si-based quantum computer
hardware. An important potential problem in this context is that inter-valley
interference originating from the degeneracy in the Si conduction band edge
causes fast oscillations in donor exchange coupling, which imposes significant
constraints on the Si quantum computer architecture. In this paper we consider
the effect of external strain on Si donor exchange in the context of quantum
computer hardware. We study donor electron exchange in uniaxially strained Si,
since strain partially lifts the valley degeneracy in the bulk. In particular,
we focus on the effects of donor displacements among lattice sites on the
exchange coupling, investigating whether inter-valley interference poses less
of a problem to exchange coupling of donors in strained Si. We show, using the
Kohn-Luttinger envelope function approach, that fast oscillations in exchange
coupling indeed disappear for donor pairs that satisfy certain conditions for
their relative positions, while in other situations the donor exchange coupling
remains oscillatory, with periods close to interatomic spacing. We also comment
on the possible role of controlled external strain in the design and

mechanics contributes both obstacles to communication in the form of noise, and
opportunities in the use of intrinsically quantum representations for

communication rate for coupled quantum channels. By exploiting quantum
correlations such as entanglement, coupled quantum channels can communicate at
a potentially higher rate than unentangled quantum channels given the same
power. In particular, given the same overall power, M coupled, entangled
quantum channels can send M bits in the same time it takes a single channel to

measurements of the variances of conditional probability distributions and are
necessary to reflect directly the situation of the original EPR paradox. The
second weaker set of EPR criteria are based on the proven failure of
(Bell-type) local realistic theories which could be consistent with a local
quantum description for each subsystem. The relationship with criteria
sufficient to prove entanglement is established, to show that any demonstration
of EPR correlations will also signify entanglement. It is also shown how a

suppressing decoherence between distinct decoherence free subspaces in quantum
registers. The effect is found in the framework of exact coherent-product
solutions for model registers decohering in a bath of degenerate harmonic
modes, through couplings linear in bath coordinates. These solutions represent
a natural nonequilibrium extension of the standard solution for a decoupled
initial register state and a thermal environment. Under appropriate conditions,
the corresponding reduced register distribution can propagate in an unperturbed
manner, even in the presence of entanglement between states belonging to
distinct decoherence free subspaces, and despite persistent bath entanglement.
As a byproduct, we also obtain a refined picture of coherence dynamics under
bang-bang decoherence control. In particular, it is shown that each
radio-frequency pulse in a typical bang-bang cycle induces a revival of
coherence, and that these revivals are exploited in a natural way by the
time-symmetrized version of the bang-bang protocol.

This ansatz provides a possible well-behaved general closure of the nonlinear

Grassmann variables or Clifford algebras, but simply by generalizing the usual

derive the zitterbewegung: namely the decomposition of the 4-velocity in the
newtonian constant term p/m and in a non-newtonian time-oscillating spacelike
term. Consequently, free classical particles do not obey, in general, the
Principle of Inertia. Superluminal motions are also allowed, without violating
Special Relativity, provided that the energy-momentum moves along the worldline
of the center-of-mass. Moreover, a non-linear, non-constant relation holds
between the time durations measured in different reference frames. Newtonian
Mechanics is re-obtained as a particular case of the present theory: namely for
spinless systems with no zitterbewegung. Introducing a Lagrangian containing
also derivatives of the 4-velocity we get a new equation of the motion,
actually a generalization of the Newton Law a=F/m. Requiring the rotational
symmetry and the reparametrization invariance we derive the classical spin

by Casimir and Polder represents a mean force, but there are large fluctuations
around this mean value on short time scales which are of the same order of
magnitude as the mean force itself. However, these fluctuations occur on time
scales which are typically of the order of the light travel time between the
atom and the plate. As a consequence, they will not be observed in an

large time limit, the magnitude of the mean squared velocity of a test particle

interpret this negative shift to correspond to a reduction in the velocity

decoherence due to the interaction with their environment, but also from severe
engineering constraints. Here we introduce a practical solution to these major
concerns, addressing solid state proposals in particular. Decoherence is first
reduced by encoding a logical qubit into two qubits, then completely eliminated
by an efficient set of decoupling pulse sequences. The same encoding removes
the need for single-qubit operations, that pose a difficult design constraint.
We further show how the dominant decoherence processes can be identified
empirically, in order to optimize the decoupling pulses.

of states with infinite entropy of entanglement is trace-norm dense in state
space, implying that in any neighborhood of every product state there lies an
arbitrarily strongly entangled state. The starting point for a clarification of
this counterintuitive property is the observation that if one imposes the
natural and physically reasonable constraint that the mean energy is bounded
from above, then the entropy of entanglement becomes a trace-norm continuous

and we will prove some asymptotic continuity properties. We proceed by
investigating the entanglement of formation and the relative entropy of
entanglement in the infinite-dimensional setting. Finally, we show that the set
of entangled states is still trace-norm dense in state space, even under the
constraint of a finite mean energy.

electron are obtained in the strong coupling regime, when the number of the
spins is taken to be, formally, infinitely large (thermodynamic limit). This
model describes a spin interacting with a spin-bath in a strong coupling regime
and gives a dephasing time at zero temperature that agrees with the recent

conduction electron oscillates between the two states with frequency going to

Then, it is shown that the only meaning that can be attached to such

the nature and the characteristics of a Schild's discrete space-time. With the
wave perturbations of its metrical structure we formulate the working
hypothesis that all subatomic particles are elementary sources of spherical
waves constituting on the whole the mass fields, the electromagnetic and the
nuclear field we attribute to the particles. The explicative effectiveness of
the new wave unification between quantum mechanics and general relativity is
shown by a wave interpretation of three experimental phenomena that lie
different physics: astrophysics, optics and quantum physics. A further use of
wave Compton effect leads us to discover a mechanism of wave resonance which is
able to verify the possible existence of a source of elementary waves that
shows a wave model of electron and all the particles. The wave nature of masses
and the generalized effect of a Relative Symmetry Principle leads us to
consider the inertia as a local consequence of the wave structure of bodies.
The same changeable wave model used for explaining inertia it is also valid to
show a quantized gravitational interaction and the wave nature of gravity.

states and generalized coherent states based on Lie algebras su(2) and su(1,1),

Quantum Information Theory. In the first half we make a general review of
coherent states and generalized coherent states based on Lie algebras su(2) and
su(1,1) from the geometric point of view and, in particular, prove that each
resolution of unity can be obtained by the curvature form of some bundle on the
parameter space. In the latter half we apply a method of generalized coherent
states to some important topics in Quantum Information Theory, in particular,
swap of coherent states and cloning of coherent ones. We construct the swap
operator of coherent states by making use of a generalized coherent operator
based on su(2) and show an ""imperfect cloning"" of coherent states, and moreover
present some related problems. In conclusion we state our dream, namely, a
construction of {\bf Geometric Quantum Information Theory}.

arbitrary interacting quantum systems by generalization of the Hartree
method.The scheme consists in approximating the original interaction term
$\lambda H_I$ by a suitable 'potential' $\lambda V(\phi)$ which satisfies the
following two requirements: (i) the 'Hartree Hamiltonian' $H_o$ generated by
$V(\phi)$ is exactly solvable i.e, the eigen states $|n>$ and the eigenvalues
$E_n$ are known and (ii) the 'quantum averages' of the two are equal, i.e. $<
n|H_I|n>$ = $<n|V(\phi)|n>$ for arbitrary $'n '$. The leading-order results for
$|n>$ and $E_n$, which are already accurate, can be systematically improved
further by the development of a 'Hartree-improved perturbation theory' (HIPT)
with $H_o$ as the unperturbed part and the modified interaction:$\lambda
H^{\prime} \equiv \lambda (H_I-V)$ as the perturbation. The HIPT is assured of
rapid convergence because of the 'Hartree condtion' : $<n| H'| n> = 0$. This is
in contrast to the naive perturbation theory developed with the original
interaction term $\lambda H_I$ chosen as the perturbation, which diverges even
for infinitesimal $\lambda$ ! The structure of the Hartree vacuum is shown to
be highly non-trivial. Application of the method to the anharmonic-and
double-well quartic-oscillators, anharmonic- sextic and octic- oscillators
leads to very accurate results for the energy levels. In case of $\lambda
\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory, the method reproduces, in the leading order,
the results of Gaussian approximation, which can be improved further by the
HIPT. We study the vacuum structure, renormalisation and stability of the
theory in GHA.

"8321","Quantum mechanics without spacetime - a possible case for noncommutative
  differential geometry?","T. P. Singh","  The rules of quantum mechanics require a time coordinate for their
formulation. However, a notion of time is in general possible only when a
classical spacetime geometry exists. Such a geometry is itself produced by
classical matter sources. Thus it could be said that the currently known
formulation of quantum mechanics pre-assumes the presence of classical matter
fields. A more fundamental formulation of quantum mechanics should exist, which
avoids having to use a notion of time. In this paper we discuss as to how such
a fundamental formulation could be constructed for single particle,
non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We argue that there is an underlying
non-linear theory of quantum gravity, to which both standard quantum mechanics
and classical general relativity are approximations. The timeless formulation
of quantum mechanics follows from the underlying theory when the mass of the
particle is much smaller than Planck mass. On the other hand, when the
particle's mass is much larger than Planck mass, spacetime emerges and the
underlying theory should reduce to classical mechanics and general relativity.
We also suggest that noncommutative differential geometry is a possible
candidate for describing this underlying theory.

  Quadrupole","S. De Nicola|R. Fedele|V. I. Man'ko","  A classical description of the dynamics of a dissipative charged-particle
fluid in a quadrupole-like device is developed. It is shown that the set of the
classical fluid equations contains the same information as a complex function
satisfying a Schrodinger-like equation in which Planck's constant is replaced
by the time-varying emittance, which is related to the time-varying temperature
of the fluid. The squared modulus and the gradient of the phase of this complex
function are proportional to the fluid density and to the current velocity,
respectively. Within this framework, the dynamics of an electron bunch in a
storage ring in the presence of radiation damping and quantum-excitation is
recovered. Furthermore, both standard and generalized (including dissipation)
coherent states that may be associated with the classical particle fluids are
fully described in terms of the above formalism.

of the space of symmetric matrices F^{ab} [corresponding to the canonical

canonical metric g_{ab}(x_0), where 1 \leq a,b \leq n, and, crucially, the

whenever \sum (u^a)^2 > 0. In an alternative quantization procedure known as
Metrical Quantization, the first and most important ingredient is the
specification of a suitable metric on classical phase space. Our choice of
phase space metrics, guided by a recent study of Affine Quantum Gravity, leads
to gravitational phase space geometries which possess constant scalar curvature
and may be regarded as higher dimensional analogs of the Poincare plane, which
applies when n=1. This result is important because phase spaces endowed with
such symmetry lead naturally via the procedures of Metrical Quantization to
acceptable Hilbert spaces of high dimension.

  Copying timing information is restricted by quantum no-cloning and

infinite energy. We show this quantitatively by comparing the Fisher timing

Lifts and Holonomy along Density Operators: Computable Examples Using
O(3)-Orbits,"" by, in fact, computing the holonomy invariants for rotations of
certain n-level Gibbsian density matrices (n = 2,...,11). From these, we
derive, by the tracing operation, the associated geometric phases and
visibilities, which we analyze and display. We then proceed analogously,
implementing the alternative methodology presented by E. Sjoqvist et al in
their letter, ""Geometric Phases for Mixed States in Interferometry"" (Phys. Rev.
Lett. 85, 2845 [2000]). For the Uhlmann case, we are able to also compute
several higher-order invariants. We compare the various geometric phases and
visibilities for different values of n, and also directly compare the two forms
of analysis. By setting one parameter (a) in the Uhlmann analysis to zero, we
find that the so-reduced form of the first-order holonomy invariant is simply
equal to (-1)^{n+1} times the holonomy invariant in the Sj\""oqvist et al
method. Additional phenomena of interest are reported too.

  Ensembles of Pure States","H. M. Wiseman|John A. Vaccaro","  As discussed in Wiseman and Vaccaro [quant-ph/9906125], the stationary state
of an optical or atom laser far above threshold is a mixture of coherent field
states with random phase, or, equivalently, a Poissonian mixture of number
states. We are interested in which, if either, of these descriptions of
$\rho_{ss}$, is more natural. In the preceding paper we concentrated upon
whether descriptions such as these are physically realizable (PR). In this
paper we investigate another relevant aspect of these ensembles, their
robustness. A robust ensemble is one for which the pure states that comprise it
survive relatively unchanged for a long time under the system evolution. We
determine numerically the most robust ensembles as a function of the parameters
in the laser model: the self-energy $\chi$ of the bosons in the laser mode, and
the excess phase noise $\nu$. We find that these most robust ensembles are PR
ensembles, or similar to PR ensembles, for all values of these parameters. In
the ideal laser limit ($\nu=\chi=0$), the most robust states are coherent
states. As the phase noise $\nu$ or phase dispersion $\chi$ is increased, the
most robust states become increasingly amplitude-squeezed. We find scaling laws
for these states. As the phase diffusion or dispersion becomes so large that
the laser output is no longer quantum coherent, the most robust states become
so squeezed that they cease to have a well-defined coherent amplitude. That is,
the quantum coherence of the laser output is manifest in the most robust PR
states having a well-defined coherent amplitude. This lends support to the idea
that robust PR ensembles are the most natural description of the state of the
laser mode. It also has interesting implications for atom lasers in particular,
for which phase dispersion due to self-interactions is expected to be large.

quantum theory for a 'quantum equilibrium' distribution of hidden variables,

for hypothetical 'nonequilibrium ensembles'. This 'signal-locality theorem'
generalises yet another feature of the pilot-wave theory of de Broglie and
Bohm, for which it is already known that signal-locality is true only in
equilibrium. Assuming certain symmetries, lower bounds are derived on the
'degree of nonlocality' of the singlet state, defined as the (equilibrium)
fraction of outcomes at one wing of an EPR-experiment that change in response
to a shift in the distant angular setting. It is shown by explicit calculation
that these bounds are satisfied by pilot-wave theory. The degree of nonlocality
is interpreted as the average number of bits of 'subquantum information'
transmitted superluminally, for an equilibrium ensemble. It is proposed that
this quantity might provide a novel measure of the entanglement of a quantum
state, and that the field of quantum information would benefit from a more
explicit hidden-variables approach. It is argued that the signal-locality

allows one to state a criterion for when self thermalization occurs. This
paradigm also provides a method for calculating the thermalization rate using
the usual formalism of atomic physics for calculating decay rates. We contrast
our prescription for coarse graining, which is somewhat dynamical, with the
earlier approaches that are intrinsically kinematical. An important motivation
for this study is the black hole information paradox.

in the Husimi representation. Therefore delocalization of the Husimi

entanglement and chaos. Our definition of the Husimi distribution can be

spherically symmetric potential $V(r) \sim r^{\nu}$ $(-2<\nu <\infty)$ and an
Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux. Numerical results are presented and compared with
known results for models with $\nu = -1,0,2,\infty$. It is shown that the
results provided by our method are in good agreement with previous results. One
expects that the semiclassical quantization rule shown in this paper will
provide a good approximation for all principle quantum number even the rule is
derived in the large principal quantum number limit $n \gg 1$. We also discuss
the power parameter $\nu $ dependence of the energy spectra pattern in this
paper.

"5522","Experimental realization of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm using
  nuclear magnetic resonance","Lieven M. K. Vandersypen|Matthias Steffen|Gregory Breyta|Costantino S. Yannoni|Mark H. Sherwood|Isaac L. Chuang","  The number of steps any classical computer requires in order to find the
prime factors of an $l$-digit integer $N$ increases exponentially with $l$, at
least using algorithms known at present. Factoring large integers is therefore
conjectured to be intractable classically, an observation underlying the
security of widely used cryptographic codes. Quantum computers, however, could
factor integers in only polynomial time, using Shor's quantum factoring
algorithm. Although important for the study of quantum computers, experimental
demonstration of this algorithm has proved elusive. Here we report an
implementation of the simplest instance of Shor's algorithm: factorization of
${N=15}$ (whose prime factors are 3 and 5). We use seven spin-1/2 nuclei in a
molecule as quantum bits, which can be manipulated with room temperature liquid
state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This method of using nuclei to
store quantum information is in principle scalable to many quantum bit systems,
but such scalability is not implied by the present work. The significance of
our work lies in the demonstration of experimental and theoretical techniques
for precise control and modelling of complex quantum computers. In particular,
we present a simple, parameter-free but predictive model of decoherence effects
in our system.

4059), we started a systematic study of the connections among different
factorization types, suggested by Infeld and Hull, and of their consequences
for the construction of algebras. We devised a general procedure for
constructing satellite algebras for all the Hamiltonians admitting a type E
factorization by using the relationship between type A and E factorizations.
Here we complete our analysis by showing that for Hamiltonians admitting a type
F factorization, a similar method, starting from either type B or type C ones,
leads to other types of algebras. We therefore conclude that the existence of
satellite algebras is a characteristic property of type E factorizable
Hamiltonians. Our results are illustrated with the detailed discussion of the
Coulomb problem.

"5822","On a Supposed Conceptual Inadequacy of the Shannon Information in
  Quantum Mechanics","C. G. Timpson","  Recently, Brukner and Zeilinger (2001) have claimed that the Shannon
information is not well defined as a measure of information in quantum
mechanics, adducing arguments that seek to show that it is inextricably tied to
classical notions of measurement. It is shown here that these arguments do not
succeed: the Shannon information does not have problematic ties to classical
concepts. In a further argument, Brukner and Zeilinger compare the Shannon
information unfavourably to their preferred measure, I(p), with regard to the
definition of a notion of `total information content'. This argument is found
unconvincing and the relationship between individual measures of information
and notions of `total information content' investigated. We close by
considering the prospects of Zeilinger's Foundational Principle as a
foundational principle for quantum mechanics

"5922","Conservative Quantum Computing","Masanao Ozawa","  Conservation laws limit the accuracy of physical implementations of
elementary quantum logic gates. If the computational basis is represented by a
component of spin and physical implementations obey the angular momentum
conservation law, any physically realizable unitary operators with size less
than n qubits cannot implement the controlled-NOT gate within the error
probability 1/(4n^2), where the size is defined as the total number of the
computational qubits and the ancilla qubits. An analogous limit for bosonic
ancillae is also obtained to show that the lower bound of the error probability
is inversely proportional to the average number of photons. Any set of
universal gates inevitably obeys a related limitation with error probability
O(1/n^2)$. To circumvent the above or related limitations yielded by
conservation laws, it is recommended that the computational basis should be
chosen as the one commuting with the additively conserved quantities.

because there is no observable for the time taken by a particle to transmit (or
reflect) from a particular region. Several methods have been proposed based on
scattering phase shifts and using different quantum clocks, where the time
taken is clocked by some external input or indirectly from the phase of the
scattering amplitudes. In this work we give a general method for calculating
conditional sojourn times based on wave attenuation. In this approach clock
mechanism does not couple to the Hamiltonian of the system. For simplicity,
specific case of a delta dimer is considered in detail. Our analysis re-affirms
recent results based on correcting quantum clocks using optical potential
methods, albeit in a much simpler way.
