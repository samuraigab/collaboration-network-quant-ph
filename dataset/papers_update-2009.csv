"1","Exact results for the criticality of quench dynamics in quantum Ising
  models","Ying Li|M. X. Huo|Z. Song","  Based on the obtained exact results we systematically study the quench
dynamics of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 transverse field Ising model with zero-
and finite-temperature initial states. We focus on the magnetization of the
system after a sudden change of the external field and a coherent
time-evolution process. With a zero-temperature initial state, the quench
magnetic susceptibility as a function of the initial field strength exhibits
strongly similar scaling behaviors to those of the static magnetic
susceptibility, and the quench magnetic susceptibility as a function of the
final field strength shows a discontinuity at the quantum critical point. This
discontinuity remains robust and always occurs at the quantum critical point
even for the case of finite-temperature initial systems, which indicates a
great advantage of employing quench dynamics to study quantum phase
transitions.

a near-optimal strategy intentionally or unintentionally when the usual
Bennett-Brassard cryptographic scheme is performed between two trusted parties.
This phenomenon tends to disappear when eavesdropping strategy moves far from
the optimal one. Therefore, we conjecture that this resonant effect is a
characteristic for the eavesdropping strategy near to optimal one. We argue
that this effect makes the quantum cryptography more secure against the
eavesdropper's attack.

"5","Overview of the structural unification of quantum mechanics and
  relativity using the algebra of quantions","Florin Moldoveanu","  The purpose of this contribution is to provide an introduction for a general
physics audience to the recent results of Emile Grgin that unifies quantum
mechanics and relativity into the same mathematical structure. This structure
is the algebra of quantions, a non-division algebra that is the natural
framework for electroweak theory on curved space-time. Similar with
quaternions, quantions preserve the core features of associativity and complex
conjugation while giving up the unnecessarily historically biased property of
division. Lack of division makes possible structural unification with
relativity (one cannot upgrade the linear Minkowski space to a division algebra
due to null light-cone vectors) and demands an adjustment from Born's standard
interpretation of the wave function in terms of probability currents. This
paper is an overview to the theory of quantions, followed by discussions.

from above by the inequality) for the two inequivalent subclasses of pure
three-qubit states: the GHZ-class and the W-class. We show that the maximum for
the GHZ-class states reduces to Mermin's inequality [Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 1838

tangle and the residual concurrence, large number of states don't violate the
inequality. We further show that by design SI is more suitable as a measure of
genuine tripartite nonlocality between the three qubits in the the W-class
states, and the maximum is a certain function of the bipartite entanglement
(the concurrence) of the three reduced states, and only when their certain sum
attains a certain threshold value, they violate the inequality.

"17","Quantum models of classical mechanics: maximum entropy packets","P. Hajicek","  In a previous paper, a project of constructing quantum models of classical
properties has been started. The present paper concludes the project by turning
to classical mechanics. The quantum states that maximize entropy for given
averages and variances of coordinates and momenta are called ME packets. They
generalize the Gaussian wave packets. A non-trivial extension of the
partition-function method of probability calculus to quantum mechanics is
given. Non-commutativity of quantum variables limits its usefulness. Still, the
general form of the state operators of ME packets is obtained with its help.
The diagonal representation of the operators is found. A general way of
calculating averages that can replace the partition function method is
described. Classical mechanics is reinterpreted as a statistical theory.
Classical trajectories are replaced by classical ME packets. Quantum states
approximate classical ones if the product of the coordinate and momentum
variances is much larger than Planck constant. Thus, ME packets with large
variances follow their classical counterparts better than Gaussian wave
packets.

generalized Hartmann effect, we consider the case in which the clock runs only
when the particle can be found inside the region \emph{between} the barriers

non negligible, the corresponding time (which in this case turns out to be a
dwell time) increases with the barrier spacing.

singled out of the many levels of an anharmonic oscillator. In these cases,
simple qubit control fails on short time scales because of coupling to leakage

leakage from any single-control analog or pixelated pulse. It is based on
adding a second control that is proportional to the time-derivative of the
first. For realistic parameters of superconducting qubits, this strategy
reduces the error by an order of magnitude relative to the state of the art,
all based on smooth and feasible pulse shapes. These results show that even
weak anharmonicity is sufficient and in general not a limiting factor for

negative refraction at dipole densities which are considerably smaller than

gets minimized due to destructive quantum interference and the ratio of
negative refraction index to absorption becomes orders of magnitude larger than
in systems without coherent cross-coupling. The proposed scheme allows for a
fine-tuning of the refractive index. We derive a generalized expression for the

subsystems is problematical in standard quantum mechanics (subentity problem).
Basing on the proposal provided in the SR interpretation of quantum mechanics,
where improper mixtures are considered as true nonpure states conceptually
distinct from proper mixtures, we show here that proper and improper mixtures
can be represented by different density operators in the quaternionic
formulation of quantum mechanics, hence they can be distinguished also from a
mathematical viewpoint. A simple example related to the quantum theory of
measurement is provided.

measure of the quality of such a token: the relative entropy of frameness. This
is defined as the relative entropy distance between the state of interest and
the nearest G-invariant state. Unlike the relative entropy of entanglement,
this quantity is straightforward to calculate and we find it to be precisely
equal to the G-asymmetry, a measure of frameness introduced by Vaccaro et al.
It is shown to provide an upper bound on the mutual information between the
group element encoded into the token and the group element that may be
extracted from it by measurement. In this sense, it quantifies the extent to
which the token successfully simulates a full reference frame. We also show,
that despite a suggestive analogy from entanglement theory, the regularized
relative entropy of frameness is zero and therefore does not quantify the rate
of interconversion between the token and some standard form of quantum
reference frame. Finally, we show how these investigations yield a novel
approach to bounding the relative entropy of entanglement.

  problem","T. P. Singh","  The cosmological constant problem is principally concerned with trying to
understand how the zero-point energy of quantum fields contributes to gravity.
Here we take the approach that by addressing a fundamental unresolved issue in
quantum theory we can gain a better understanding of the problem. Our starting
point is the observation that the notion of classical time is external to
quantum mechanics. Hence there must exist an equivalent reformulation of
quantum mechanics which does not refer to an external classical time. Such a
reformulation is a limiting case of a more general quantum theory which becomes
nonlinear on the Planck mass/energy scale. The nonlinearity gives rise to a
quantum-classical duality which maps a `strongly quantum, weakly gravitational'
dynamics to a `weakly quantum, strongly gravitational' dynamics. This duality
predicts the existence of a tiny nonzero cosmological constant of the order of
the square of the Hubble constant, which could be a possible source for the
observed cosmic acceleration. Such a nonlinearity could also be responsible for
the collapse of the wave-function during a quantum measurement. We conclude by
suggesting that the idea for the origin of dark energy proposed in this paper
can be tested indirectly in the laboratory by a detailed examination of the
process of quantum measurement.

of the randomness introduced by damping, the dissipated power (viewed as the
oscillator output) does not fluctuate slowly. Comparison is made with quiet
laser oscillators discovered theoretically in 1984. Because the input power

On the other hand, the discrete spectrum may be empty for general deformations.

"67","Quantum-like gravity waves and vortices in a classical fluid","Laurent Nottale","  We have recently proposed a new general concept of macroscopic quantum-type
experiment. It amounts to transform a classical fluid into a quantum-type fluid
by the application of a quantum-like potential, either directly in a stationary
configuration, or through a retro-active loop to simulate the time evolution.
In this framework, the amplitude of the quantum potential depends on a
macroscopic generalization of the Planck constant, which can be changed during
the experiment, therefore simulating a quantum to classical transition. The
experiment is exemplified here by an application of this concept to gravity
waves at the surface of an incompressible liquid in a basin of finite height,
with particular emphasis on the quantized vortex. We construct a complex wave
function with the height of the fluid in the basin as its square modulus and
the velocity potential as its phase. This wave function is solution of a
nonlinear Schrodinger equation typical of superfluids. The quantum potential is
therefore defined here in terms of the square root of the fluid height. We
suggest two methods for applying this quantum-like potential to the fluid: (i)
by the action of a force on the surface (wind, blower, pressure, field,
etc...); (ii) by a curvature of the basin ground. In this last case the ground
profile yields the quantum potential itself, while usually only the quantum
force is accessible, so that such an experiment is expected to provide one with
a macroscopic model of a quantum-type vacuum energy. These results may also be
relevant to the study of freak waves, which have already been described by
nonlinear Schrodinger equations.

"68","Bayesian Generalized Probability Calculus for Density Matrices","Manfred K Warmuth|Dima Kuzmin","  One of the main concepts in quantum physics is a density matrix, which is a
symmetric positive definite matrix of trace one. Finite probability
distributions can be seen as a special case when the density matrix is
restricted to be diagonal.
  We develop a probability calculus based on these more general distributions
that includes definitions of joints, conditionals and formulas that relate
these, including analogs of the Theorem of Total Probability and various Bayes
rules for the calculation of posterior density matrices. The resulting calculus
parallels the familiar ""conventional"" probability calculus and always retains
the latter as a special case when all matrices are diagonal. We motivate both
the conventional and the generalized Bayes rule with a minimum relative entropy
principle, where the Kullbach-Leibler version gives the conventional Bayes rule
and Umegaki's quantum relative entropy the new Bayes rule for density matrices.
  Whereas the conventional Bayesian methods maintain uncertainty about which
model has the highest data likelihood, the generalization maintains uncertainty
about which unit direction has the largest variance. Surprisingly the bounds
also generalize: as in the conventional setting we upper bound the negative log
likelihood of the data by the negative log likelihood of the MAP estimator.

Prerequisite to this regime are both preparation of the mechanical oscillator

spread of the oscillator's ground state wavefunction. It has been widely
perceived that the most promising approach to address these two challenges are
electro nanomechanical systems. Here we approach for the first time the quantum
regime with a mechanical oscillator of mesoscopic dimensions--discernible to
the bare eye--and 1000-times more massive than the heaviest nano-mechanical

displacement at the attometer level, and the ability to use measurement induced
dynamic back-action to achieve resolved sideband laser cooling of the
mechanical degree of freedom. Using only modest cryogenic pre-cooling to 1.65

nanoscale mechanical devices achieved operation close to the quantum regime. We
report a new micro-optomechanical resonator that is laser cooled to a level of
30 thermal quanta. This is equivalent to the best nanomechanical devices,
however, with a mass more than four orders of magnitude larger (43 ng versus 1
pg) and at more than two orders of magnitude higher environment temperature (5
K versus 30 mK). Despite the large laser-added cooling factor of 4,000 and the
cryogenic environment, our cooling performance is not limited by residual
absorption effects. These results pave the way for the preparation of 100-um

  driven periodically through quantum critical points","Victor Mukherjee|Amit Dutta","  We study the effects of interference on the quenching dynamics of a
one-dimensional spin 1/2 $XY$ model in the presence of a transverse field
($h(t)$) which varies sinusoidally with time as $h = h_0\cos{\omega t}$, with
$|t| \leq t_f = \pi/\omega$. We also consider the situation where the magnetic
field consists of an oscillatory as well as a linearly varying component, i.e.,
$h(t) = h_0\cos{\omega t} + t/\tau$. Our purpose is to estimate the defect
density and the local entropy density in the final state if the system is
initially prepared in its ground state. For a single crossing through the
quantum critical point with $h = h_0\cos{\omega t}$, the density of defects in
the final state is calculated by mapping the dynamics to an equivalent Landau
Zener problem by linearizing near the crossing point, and is found to vary as
$\sqrt{\omega}$ in the limit of small $\omega$. On the other hand, the local
entropy density is found to attain a maximum as a function of $\omega$ near a
characteristic scale $\omega_0$. Extending to the situation of multiple
crossings, we show that the non-trivial interference effects of certain
resonance modes solely contribute to the production of defects. Kink density as
well as the diagonal entropy density show oscillatory dependence on the number
of full cycles of oscillation. Finally, the inclusion of a linear term in the
transverse field on top of the oscillatory component, results to a kink density
which decreases continuously with $\tau$ and $\omega$. The entropy density
shows monotonous growth with both $\tau$ and $\omega$, in sharp contrast to the
situations studied earlier. We do also propose appropriate scaling relations
for the defect density in above situations and compare the results with the
numerical results obtained by integrating the Schrodinger equations.

We show how the theory of CMV matrices gives a natural tool to study these
processes and to give results that are analogous to those that Karlin and
McGregor developed to study (classical) birth-and-death processes using
orthogonal polynomials on the real line. In perfect analogy with the classical
case the study of QRWs on the set of non-negative integers can be handled using
scalar valued (Laurent) polynomials and a scalar valued measure on the circle.
In the case of classical or quantum random walks on the integers one needs to
allow for matrix valued versions of these notions. We show how our tools yield
results in the well known case of the Hadamard walk, but we go beyond this
translation invariant model to analyze examples that are hard to analyze using
other methods. More precisely we consider QRWs on the set of non- negative
integers. The analysis of these cases leads to phenomena that are absent in the
case of QRWs on the integers even if one restricts oneself to a constant coin.
This is illustrated here by studying recurrence properties of the walk, but the

distribution of relative frequencies of outcomes from the universe of
elementary events produced by that phenomenon, that constitutes the factual
probability law to be asserted on this universe; nor is it known what

nonclassicality, conditions of higher order squeezing and higher order
subpoissonian photon statistics are derived. A simpler form of the Hong-Mandel
higher order squeezing criterion is derived under this framework by using an
operator ordering theorem introduced by us in [J. Phys. A. 33 (2000) 5607]. It
is also generalized for multi-photon Bose operators of Brandt and Greenberg.
Similarly, condition for higher order subpoissonian photon statistics is
derived by normal ordering of higher powers of number operator. Further, with
the help of simple density matrices, it is shown that the higher order
antibunching (HOA) and higher order subpoissonian photon statistics (HOSPS) are
not the manifestation of the same phenomenon and consequently it is incorrect
to use the condition of HOA as a test of HOSPS. It is also shown that the HOA
and HOSPS may exist even in absence of the corresponding lower order
phenomenon. Binomial state, nonlinear first order excited squeezed state
(NLESS) and nonlinear vacuum squeezed state (NLVSS) are used as examples of
quantum state and it is shown that these states may show higher order
nonclssical characteristics. It is observed that the Binomial state which is
always antibunched, is not always higher order squeezed and NLVSS which shows
higher order squeezing does not show HOSPS and HOA. The opposite is observed in
NLESS and consequently it is established that the HOSPS and HOS are two
independent signatures of higher order nonclassicality

between the interactions, as $J_-(t)\sim -|t/\tau|$. Here, time $t$ goes from
$-\infty$ to $+\infty$ and $\tau$ defines the rate of change of the
Hamiltonian. In other words, the spin chain initially prepared in its ground
state is driven by changing $J_-$ linearly in time up to the quantum critical
point, which in the model considered here occurs at at $t=0$, reversed and then
gradually decreased to its initial value at the same rate. We have thoroughly
compared the reverse quenching with its counterpart forward quenching $i.e.,$
$J_-\sim t/\tau$. Our exact calculation shows that the probability of
excitations is zero for the wave vector at which the instantaneous energy gap
is zero at the critical point $J_{-}=0$ as opposed to the maximum value of
unity in the forward quenching. It is also shown that the defect density in the
final state following a reverse quenching, we propose here, is nearly half of
the defects generated in the forward quenching. We argue that the defects
produced when the system reaches the quantum critical point gets redistributed
in the wave vector space at the final time in case of reverse quenching whereas
it keeps on increasing till the final time in the forward quenching. We study
the entropy density and also the time evolution of the diagonal entropy density

basic idea of an integrability condition to certain multiple parametrized

symmetry of a collective submanifold in which a canonicity condition makes the
collective variables to be an orthogonal coordinate-system. For this aim we
adopt a concept of curvature unfamiliar in the conventional time-dependent (TD)
self-consistent field (SCF) theory. Our basic idea lies in the introduction of
a sort of Lagrange manner familiar to fluid dynamics to describe a collective
coordinate-system. This manner enables us to take a one-form which is linearly
composed of a TD SCF Hamiltonian and infinitesimal generators induced by
collective variable differentials of a canonical transformation on a group. The
integrability condition of the system read the curvature C=0. Our method is

the channel's elements. The effect of the channel on these observables can be
reversed by another physical transformation. These results generalize the

  The preserved unsharp observables (positive operator-valued measures) allow
for a finer characterization of the information preserved by a channel. We show
that the only type of information which can be duplicated arbitrarily many

collapse and the revival of the Rabi oscillations in the Jaynes-Cummings model
(JCM). The JCM is an exactly soluble quantum mechanical model, which describes
the interaction between a two-level atom and a single cavity mode of the
electromagnetic field. If we prepare the atom in the ground state and the
cavity mode in a coherent state initially, the JCM causes the collapse and the
revival of the Rabi oscillations many times in a complicated pattern in its
time-evolution. In this phenomenon, the atomic population inversion is
described with an intractable infinite series. (When the electromagnetic field
is resonant with the atom, the $n$th term of this infinite series is given by a
trigonometric function for $\sqrt{n}t$, where $t$ is a variable of the time.)
According to Klimov and Chumakov's method, using the Abel-Plana formula, we
rewrite this infinite series as a sum of two integrals. We examine the physical
meanings of these two integrals and find that the first one represents the
initial collapse (the semi-classical limit) and the second one represents the
revival (the quantum correction) in the JCM. Furthermore, we evaluate the first
and second-order perturbations for the time-evolution of the JCM with an
initial thermal coherent state for the cavity mode at low temperature, and
write down their correction terms as sums of integrals by making use of the
Abel-Plana formula.

many areas of physics, chemistry, and biology. The uncontrollable interaction

deteriorate its transport capacity, especially so when the system is
fundamentally quantum mechanical. Here we identify key mechanisms through which
noise such as dephasing, perhaps counter intuitively, may actually aid
transport through a dissipative network by opening up additional pathways for
excitation transfer. We show that these are processes that lead to the
inhibition of destructive interference and exploitation of line broadening
effects. We illustrate how these mechanisms operate on a fully connected
network by developing a powerful analytical technique that identifies the
invariant (excitation trapping) subspaces of a given Hamiltonian. Finally, we
show how these principles can explain the remarkable efficiency and robustness

bacterial reaction center in photosynthetic complexes and present a numerical
analysis of excitation transport across the Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) complex

PST of a qubit over distance regular spin networks and optimal state transfer
(ST) of a $d$-level quantum state (qudit) over pseudo distance regular networks
were discussed, where the networks considered there were not in general related
with a certain finite group. In this paper, PST of a qudit over antipodes of
more general networks called underlying networks of association schemes, is
investigated. In particular, we consider the underlying networks of group
association schemes in order to employ the group properties (such as
irreducible characters) and use the algebraic structure of these networks (such
as Bose-Mesner algebra) in order to give an explicit analytical formula for
coupling constants in the Hamiltonians so that the state of a particular qudit

without any dynamical control. It is shown that the only necessary condition in
order to PST over these networks be achieved is that the centers of the

networks of the group association schemes over all the groups with non-trivial
centers such as the abelian groups, the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ with even $n$,

understood as information that each one carries about the other. In order to
give a model-independent description of secure information disposal, we propose
the paradigm of private quantum decoupling, corresponding to locally reducing
correlations in a given bipartite quantum state without transferring them to
the environment. In this framework, the concept of private local randomness
naturally arises as a resource, and total correlations get divided into
eliminable and ineliminable ones. We prove upper and lower bounds on the amount
of ineliminable correlations present in an arbitrary bipartite state, and show
that, in tripartite pure states, ineliminable correlations satisfy a monogamy
constraint, making apparent their quantum nature. A relation with entanglement
theory is provided by showing that ineliminable correlations constitute an
entanglement parameter. In the limit of infinitely many copies of the initial
state provided, we compute the regularized ineliminable correlations to be
measured by the coherent information, which is thus equipped with a new
operational interpretation. In particular, our results imply that two
subsystems can be privately decoupled if their joint state is separable.

bosons in one dimension, or spin-polarized fermions. The procedure is based on
a combination of weakening and squeezing of the trapping potential. For the
resulting state, the full atom number distribution is obtained. Starting with
an unknown number of particles $N_i$, we optimize the sudden change in the
trapping potential which leads to the Fock state of $N_f$ particles in the
final trap. Non-zero temperature effects as well as different smooth trapping
potentials are analyzed. A simple criterion is provided to ensure the robust
preparation of the Fock state for physically realistic traps.

"632","Analysis of Lyapunov Method for Control of Quantum States","Xiaoting Wang|Sonia Schirmer","  The natural trajectory tracking problem is studied for generic quantum states
represented by density operators. A control design based on the Hilbert-Schmidt
distance as a Lyapunov function is considered. The control dynamics is
redefined on an extended space where the LaSalle invariance principle can be
correctly applied even for non-stationary target states. LaSalle's invariance
principle is used to derive a general characterization of the invariant set,
which is shown to always contain the critical points of the Lyapunov function.
Critical point analysis of the latter is used to show that, for generic states,
it is a Morse function with $n!$ isolated critical points, including one global
minimum, one global maximum and $n!-2$ saddles. It is also shown, however, that
the actual dynamics of the system is not a gradient flow, and therefore a full
eigenvalue analysis of the linearized dynamics about the critical points of the
dynamical system is necessary to ascertain stability of the critical points.
This analysis shows that a generic target state is locally asymptotically
stable if the linearized system is controllable and the invariant set is
regular, and in fact convergence to the target state (trajectory) in this case
is almost global in that the stable manifolds of all other critical points form
a subset of measure zero of the state space. On the other hand, if either of
these sufficient conditions is not satisfied, the target state ceases to be
asymptotically stable, a center manifold emerges around the target state, and
the control design ceases to be effective.

  of Quantum Mechanics","Paul L. Csonka","  We modify the Relative State Interpretation (RSI) of Quantum Mechanics so
that it does not imply many worlds and parallel realities. We drop the
assumption that probability amplitudes correspond one-to-one with reality: Not
all information is contained in amplitudes, and not all amplitudes need be
realized. Amplitudes do not ""collapse"" after a measurement, but evolve
continuously, including unrealized ones. After each ""event"" only one possible
outcome is realized. Therefore, if a value is measured, that value is real, all
others are not; there is only one reality and one world. Reality content is
""quantized"" : unity for realized outcomes, zero for all others. It is
""conserved"": can move along any possible sequence of events, but only one at a
time. The modified RSI is is strictly deterministic in the sense that the
""global"" probability amplitudes of the universe are determined for all times by
the laws of physics and the initial conditions. They guide all events. But it
is not deterministic in the sense that from the amplitudes one can not predict
which outcome actually happens; that represents new information that
accumulates as history unfolds. To the extent that information is part of the
physical world, the coming into being of the universe is ongoing, even after
the Big Bang. All predictions of the two versions agree, except possibly in
esoteric, untested cases.

"702","Upper bounds for the secure key rate of decoy state quantum key
  distribution","Marcos Curty|Tobias Moroder|Xiongfeng Ma|Hoi-Kwong Lo|Norbert Lütkenhaus","  The use of decoy states in quantum key distribution (QKD) has provided a
method for substantially increasing the secret key rate and distance that can
be covered by QKD protocols with practical signals. The security analysis of
these schemes, however, leaves open the possibility that the development of
better proof techniques, or better classical post-processing methods, might
further improve their performance in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we
derive upper bounds on the secure key rate for decoy state QKD. These bounds
are based basically only on the classical correlations established by the
legitimate users during the quantum communication phase of the protocol. The
only assumption about the possible post-processing methods is that double click
events are randomly assigned to single click events. Further we consider only
secure key rates based on the uncalibrated device scenario which assigns
imperfections such as detection inefficiency to the eavesdropper. Our analysis
relies on two preconditions for secure two-way and one-way QKD: The legitimate
users need to prove that there exists no separable state (in the case of
two-way QKD), or that there exists no quantum state having a symmetric
extension (one-way QKD), that is compatible with the available measurements
results. Both criteria have been previously applied to evaluate single-photon
implementations of QKD. Here we use them to investigate a realistic source of
weak coherent pulses. The resulting upper bounds can be formulated as a convex
optimization problem known as a semidefinite program which can be efficiently
solved. For the standard four-state QKD protocol, they are quite close to known
lower bounds, thus showing that there are clear limits to the further
improvement of classical post-processing techniques in decoy state QKD.

faithful modeling of the employed quantum states. Many photon sources, like for
instance a parametric down conversion (PDC) source, require a multi-mode
description, but are usually only considered in a single-mode representation.
In general, the important claim in decoy-based QKD protocols for
indistinguishability between signal and decoy states does not hold for all
sources. We derive new bounds on the single photon transmission probability and
error rate for multi-mode states, and apply these bounds to the output state of
a PDC source. We observe two opposing effects on the secure key rate. First,
the multi-mode structure of the state gives rise to a new attack that decreases
the key rate. Second, more contributing modes change the photon number
distribution from a thermal towards a Poissonian distribution, which increases
the key rate.

the system in terms of a Hamiltonian describing the atom-field interaction in
the presence of a homogeneous gravitational field will be presented. Then, the
super-operator technique will be generalized and an exact solution of the
non-Markovian master equation will be obtained. Assuming that initially the
radiation field is prepared in a Glauber coherent state and the two-level atom
is in the excited state, the non-Markovian effects on the temporal evolution of
collapses and revivals of the atomic population inversion and photon counting
statistics of the radiation field in the presence of both the phase damping and
a homogeneous gravitational field will be investigated.

The terms of the Hamiltonian of this system give rise to a competition between
single and double topologies. By studying the energy spectra of the Hamiltonian
at different values of the coupling constants, we find extended gapless regions
which include a large number of critical points described by conformal field
theories with central charge c=1. These theories are part of the Z_2 orbifold
of the bosonic theory compactified on a circle. We observe that the Hilbert
space of our anyonic model can be associated with extended Dynkin diagrams of
affine Lie algebras which yields exact solutions at some critical points. In
certain special regimes, our model corresponds to the Hamiltonian limit of the
Ashkin-Teller model, and hence integrability over a wide range of coupling
parameters is established.

  diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model","Sumanta Tewari|Roman M. Lutchyn|S. Das Sarma","  Building on the work of Fisher et al. (Phys. Rev. B 40, 546 (1989)), we
develop a framework for perturbation theory in the Bose-Hubbard model and apply
it to calculate the effects of a degenerate gas of spin-polarized fermions
interacting by contact interactions with the constituent bosons. For the
single-band Bose-Hubbard model, the only non-trivial effect of the fermions is
to induce an effective space- and time-dependent density-density interaction
among the bosons. Using a path integral formulation, we develop the appropriate
theory describing the perturbative effects of this fermion-mediated interaction
(fermionic screening) on the generic superfluid-insulator phase diagram. For
the single-band Bose-Hubbard model, we find that the net effect of the fermions
is to inherently suppress the Mott-insulating lobes and enhance the area
occupied by the superfluid phase in the phase diagram. For the more general
multi-band Bose-Hubbard model, we find that, in addition to the fermion
screening of the boson interactions, the virtual excitations of the bosons to
the higher Bloch bands coupled with the contact interactions with the fermions
result in an effective increase of the boson on-site repulsion. If this
renormalization of the boson on-site potential is dominant over the fermion
screening of the boson interactions, the area of the Mott insulating lobes of
the Bose-Hubbard phase diagram will be enhanced for either sign of the
boson-fermion interactions, as seen in recent experiments.

independence of the geometry of the internal space, the Casimir forces are seen
to be attractive for special cases of Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions

different character of relevant noises: while the statistics of
Stern-Gerlach-like measurements is governed by binomial statistics, the
detection of quadrature variances correspond to chi-square statistics. For
Gaussian and near Gaussian states the suggested method provides, compared to
standard tomography techniques, more stable and reliable reconstructions. In
addition, by putting together reconstruction methods for Gaussian and arbitrary

"283","Excitation spectra, spin structures, and entanglement characteristics of
  four-electron double-quantum-dot artificial molecules","Ying Li|Constantine Yannouleas|Uzi Landman","  Energy spectra, spin configurations, and entanglement characteristics of a
system of four electrons in lateral double quantum dots are investigated using
exact diagonalization (EXD), as a function of interdot separation, applied
magnetic field, and strength of interelectron repulsion. A distinctly different
quantum behavior is found compared to that of circular single quantum dots. As
a function of the magnetic field, the energy spectra exhibit a low-energy band
consisting of a group of six states, with the number six being a consequence of
the conservation of the total spin of the four electrons and the ensuing spin
degeneracies. These six states appear to cross at a single value of the
magnetic field, with the crossing point becoming sharper for larger interdot
distances. As the strength of the Coulomb repulsion increases, the six states
tend to become degenerate and a well defined energy gap separates them from the
higher-in-energy excited states.
  The appearance of the low-energy band is a consequence of the formation of a
Wigner supermolecule, with the four electrons (two in each dot) being localized
at the vertices of a rectangular parallelogram. Using the spin-resolved
pair-correlation functions, one can map the EXD many-body wave functions onto
the spin functions associated with the four localized electrons. Analogies with
nanomagnets, such as finite Heisenberg clusters, are discussed. The ability to
determine associated spin functions enables investigations concerning
entanglement properties of the system of four electrons. In particular, the
formation of Wigner supermolecules generates EXD solutions belonging to the
class of strongly entangled states referred to as N-qubit Dicke states in the
quantum-information literature.

also generalize the so called private states -- those that possess private key.
We then show that the problem of distributed compression of quantum information
at distant sources can be solved in terms of mutual independence, if free
entanglement between the senders and the receiver is available. Namely, we
obtain a formula for the sum of rates of qubits needed to transmit a
distributed state between Alice and Bob to a decoder Charlie. We also show that
mutual independence is bounded from above by the relative entropy modulo a
conjecture, saying that if after removal of a single qubit the state becomes
product, its initial entanglement is bounded by 1. We suspect that mutual
independence is a highly singular quantity, i.e. that it is positive only on a
set of measure zero; furthermore, we believe that its presence is seen on the
single copy level. This appears to be born out in the classical case.

occupied by an electron or not. To prepare a general state in the full Hilbert
space of $n$ qubits, which is of dimension $2^{n}$%, $O(2^{n})$ controlled-NOT
gates are needed, i.e., the number of gates scales \emph{exponentially} with

functions of the number of particles for four quantum many-body systems, i.e.
atoms, nuclei, atomic clusters, and correlated atoms in a trap (bosons). A pair
of order and disorder strengths, evaluated for each system, can serve as a Pair
of Order-Disorder Indices (PODI), characterizing quantitatively order versus
disorder in any quantum system. According to the above classification, we
assign to bosons the complexity character of disorder, to atoms the character
of order, while nuclei and atomic clusters are (less) disordered and lie
between them. This criterion can be used to estimate the relative contribution
of order and disorder to complexity for other more complicated quantum systems
as well and even classical ones, if one is able to describe them
probabilistically. We also address the issue, whether those systems can grow in
complexity as the number of particles increases. Our comparative study
indicates that atoms are the only quantum system out of four, which is ordered,
with the ability to self-organize. We conjecture that this is an
information-theoretic reason that atoms are suitable as building blocks of
larger structures of biological interest i.e. molecules and macromolecules.
This is in the spirit of Wheeler's ""it from bit"" quote, the project to present

classically. One such restriction is that we cannot copy an arbitrary quantum
state. This is known as No-cloning theorem. Although quantum mechanics forbid
us to construct a perfect cloner, there is no restriction to construct an
imperfect cloner. Therefore, we have constructed and studied a special kind of
quantum cloning machine named as Hybrid quantum cloning machine which is
nothing but a different combination of pre-existing quantum cloning machines.
We showed that this hybrid quantum cloning machine sometime gives better
quality copy than the pre-existing quantum cloners. Quantum entanglement is a
very astonishing property in a multi-partite system and it is a very useful
ingredient of quantum information theory. Therefore broadcasting (cloning) of
entanglement is a very important subject to study. In this regard we have
studied the broadcasting of entanglement using state dependent quantum cloning
machine. Further, we have investigated the problem of secretly broadcasting of
three-qubit entangled state between two distant partners. Linearity of quantum
mechanics put another restriction on deletion of an arbitrary quantum state
i.e. an arbitrary quantum state against a copy cannot be perfectly deleted.
Like cloning machine one can construct an approximate deletion machine also.
Therefore, we have constructed an universal deletion machine in the sense that
the fidelity of deletion does not depend on the input state and showed that the
fidelity of deletion is 3/4 . Further we showed that the fidelity of deletion
depends on the blank state at the output and it can be improved from the value
3/4 for certain blank state. Moreover, we have studied the case where two
cloned copies are given at the input of the deletion machine.

multiple copies of a (bipartite or multipartite) quantum system that directly
provide one a value for some entanglement measure, such as the concurrence for
bipartite states. Multiple copies are needed since the entanglement of a mixed
state is not a linear function of the density matrix. Unfortunately, so far all
experimental implementations of direct measurements made unverified assumptions
about the form of the states, and, therefore, do not qualify as entanglement
verification tests. I discuss how a direct measurement can be turned into a
quantitative entanglement verification test by exploiting a recent theorem by

transmission of an entangled photon pair over a 144 km free-space link. The
received entangled states have excellent, noise-limited fidelity, even though
they are exposed to extreme attenuation dominated by turbulent atmospheric
effects. The total channel loss of 64 dB corresponds to the estimated
attenuation regime for a two-photon satellite quantum communication scenario.
We confirm that the received two-photon states are still highly entangled by
violating the CHSH inequality by more than 5 standard deviations. From a
fundamental point of view, our results show that the photons are virtually not
subject to decoherence during their 0.5 ms long flight through air, which is
encouraging for future world-wide quantum communication scenarios.

entangled states. Quantifying the amount of entanglement that was actually

exponentially with the number of qubits and becomes infeasible even for
moderate numbers of particles. Non-trivial bounds on experimentally prepared
entanglement can however be obtained from partial information on the density

  We formulate the problem mathematically employing methods from the theory of
semi-definite programming and then address this problem for the case, where the
goal of the experiment is the creation of graph states. The observables that we
consider are the generators of the stabilizer group, thus the number of
measurement settings grows only linearly in the number of qubits. We provide
analytical solutions as well as numerical methods that may be applied directly

the behavior of classical games when played in the coming quantum computing
environment or when played with quantum information. In almost all cases, the

  The study of so-called quantum games is quite new, arising from a seminal

ensuing near decade has seen an explosion of contributions and controversy over
what exactly a quantized game really is and if there is indeed anything new for

  error correction","A. Shabani|D. A. Lidar","  We show that quantum subdynamics of an open quantum system can always be
described by a Hermitian map, irrespective of the form of the initial total
system state. Since the theory of quantum error correction was developed based
on the assumption of completely positive (CP) maps, we present a generalized
theory of linear quantum error correction, which applies to any linear map
describing the open system evolution. In the physically relevant setting of
Hermitian maps, we show that the CP-map based version of quantum error
correction theory applies without modifications. However, we show that a more
general scenario is also possible, where the recovery map is Hermitian but not
CP. Since non-CP maps have non-positive matrices in their range, we provide a
geometric characterization of the positivity domain of general linear maps. In
particular, we show that this domain is convex, and that this implies a simple
algorithm for finding its boundary.

experiment a particle's path through the slits is determined by measuring the
Coulomb field that it produces at large distances; under these conditions the
interference pattern must be suppressed. The key is that as the particle's
trajectory is bent in diffraction by the slits it must radiate and the
radiation must carry away phase information. Thus the radiation field must be a
quantized dynamical degree of freedom. On the other hand, if one similarly
tries to determine the path of a massive particle through an inferometer by
measuring the Newtonian gravitational potential the particle produces, the
interference pattern would have to be finer than the Planck length and thus
undiscernable. Unlike for the electromagnetic field, Bohr's argument does not

that this and related approaches fail to take into consideration two different

explaining the microscopic structure of classical objects. If interpreting

from a pure state or, more generally, from a statistical ensemble. In the
preceding article [W. Yang and R. B. Liu, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{78}, 085315
(2008)], we have developed the cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) theory for
the so-called single-sample bath dynamics initiated from a factorizable pure
state. Here we present the ensemble CCE theory, which is based on similar ideas
of the single-sample CCE: The bath evolution is factorized into the product of
all possible cluster correlations, each of which accounts for the authentic
(non-factorizable) collective excitation of a group of bath spins, and for the
finite-time evolution in the qubit decoherence problem, convergent results can
be obtained by truncating the ensemble CCE by keeping cluster correlations up
to a certain size. A difference between the ensemble CCE and single-sample CCE
is that the mean-field treatment in the latter formalism of the diagonal part
of the spin-spin interaction in the bath is not possible in the former case.
The ensemble CCE can be applied to non-factorizable initial states. The
ensemble CCE is checked against the exact solution of an XY spin bath model.
For small spin baths, it is shown that single-sample dynamics is sensitive to
the sampling of the initial state from a thermal ensemble and hence very
different from the ensemble average.

Entanglement can be extended to long distances by applying successive

already been demonstrated experimentally with high precision. Our calculation
shows that the distribution rate of entanglement achievable with such an

rates that are achievable with the best known schemes based on atomic ensemble

entanglement swapping operations are performed deterministically, in contrast
to success probabilities below 50 percent per swapping with linear optics. The
scheme requires efficient collection of the emitted photons, which can be
achieved with cavities, and efficient conversion of their wavelength, which can
be done via stimulated parametric down-conversion. We also suggest how to

"854","Algebraic aspects of quantum indiscernibility","Decio Krause|Hercules de Araujo Feitosa","  Quasi-set theory was proposed as a mathematical context to investigate
collections of indistinguishable objects. After presenting an outline of this
theory, we define an algebra that has most of the standard properties of an
orthocomplete orthomodular lattice, which is the lattice of the closed
subspaces of a Hilbert space. We call the mathematical structure so obtained
$\mathfrak{I}$-lattice. After discussing, in a preliminary form, some aspects
of such a structure, we indicate the next problem of axiomatizing the
corresponding logic, that is, a logic which has $\mathfrak{I}$-lattices as its
algebraic models. We suggest that the intuitions that the `logic of quantum
mechanics' would be not classical logic (with its Boolean algebra), is
consonant with the idea of considering indistinguishability right from the
start, that is, as a primitive concept. In other words, indiscernibility seems
to lead `directly' to $\mathfrak{I}$-lattices. In the first sections, we
present the main motivations and a `classical' situation which mirrors that one
we focus on the last part of the paper. This paper is our first study of the
algebraic structure of indiscernibility within quasi-set theory.

using two consecutive cycles with opposite directions of the magnetic field and
opposite signs of the interaction constant. In the nonadiabatic case, starting

method conserves both the probabilities in the density matrix and the norms of
the state vectors exactly, and sheds new light on non-Markovian dynamics. The
dynamics of the pure state ensemble illustrates how local-in-time master
equation can describe memory effects and how the current state of the system
carries information on its earlier state. Our approach solves the problem of
negative jump probabilities of the Markovian MCWF method in the non-Markovian

this respect, we regard the former as a direct generalization of the latter,
allowing a rotational quantum flow. We then ask for the most likely wave
function possessing a given average energy by maximizing the Shannon
information entropy over the quantum probability density. We show that there
exists a class of solutions in which the wave function is self-trapped,
rotationally symmetric, spatially localized with finite support, and spinning
around its center, yet stationary. The stationarity comes from the balance
between the attractive quantum force field of a trapping quantum potential
generated by quantum probability density and the repulsive centrifugal force of
a rotating velocity vector field. We further show that there is a limiting case
where the wave function is non-spinning and yet still stationary. This special
state turns out to be the lowest stationary state of the ordinary Schr\""odinger
equation for a particle in a cylindrical tube classical potential.

of the background electromagnetic field and their mutual interaction, are
defined in an extended Hilbert space associated to the different

to the scattered laser field, like optical spectrum, intensity-intensity

in a unified way both the full quantum nature of the scattered laser field as

in detail the case of two plane-parallel material slabs, separated by an empty

including their surfaces, the electromagnetic fields always satisfy free-field
canonical equal-time commutation relations. This result is a consequence of
general analyticity and fall-off properties at large frequencies satisfied by
the reflection coefficients of all real materials. It is also shown that this
result does not obtain in the case of conductors, if the latter are modelled as
perfect mirrors. In such a case, the free-field form of the commutation
relations is recovered only at large distances from the mirrors, in agreement
with the findings of previous authors. Failure of perfect-mirror boundary

relativistic observer-participant manner, an operator symmetry of ""microscopic
observer-participation"" called Measurement Color (MC) is incorporated into the
field theoretic structure of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in the Heisenberg
Picture. It is found that the resultant Measurement Color Quantum
Electrodynamics (MC-QED) contains a microscopic quantum electrodynamic arrow of
time that emerges dynamically, independent of any thermodynamic or cosmological
assumptions. This occurs because the photon has a negative time parity in
MC-QED. This causes a spontaneous breaking of the T and CPT symmetry to be
generated by the physical requirement that a stable vacuum state exists in the
MC-QED formalimm. This dynamically selects operator solutions containing a
causal, retarded, quantum electrodynamic arrow of time due in the Heisenberg
operator equations of motion. In support of the validity of this idea we show
that a classic nonlinear optics experiment in the scientific literature, which
involves a Michelson interferometer using combinations of ordinary mirrors and
phase conjugate mirrors, contains experimental results which support the idea
that the photon has a negative parity under Wigner time reversal and thus
carries the arrow of time in the universe.

"919","Hyperfine frequency shift in two-dimensional atomic hydrogen","A. I. Safonov|I. I. Safonova|I. S. Yasnikov","  We propose the explanation of a surprisingly small hyperfine frequency shift
in the two-dimensional (2D) atomic hydrogen bound to the surface of superfluid
helium below 0.1 K. Owing to the symmetry considerations, the microwave-induced
triplet-singlet transitions of atomic pairs in the fully spin-polarized sample
are forbidden. The apparent nonzero shift is associated with the
density-dependent wall shift of the hyperfine constant and the pressure shift
due to the presence of H atoms in the hyperfine state $a$ not involved in the
observed $b\to c$ transition. The interaction of adsorbed atoms with one
another effectively decreases the binding energy and, consequently, the wall
shift by the amount proportional to their density. The pressure shift of the
$b\to c$ resonance comes from the fact that the impurity $a$-state atoms
interact differently with the initial $b$-state and final $c$-state atoms and
is also linear in density. The net effect of the two contributions, both
specific for 2D hydrogen, is comparable with the experimental observation. To
our knowledge, this is the first mentioning of the density-dependent wall
shift. We also show that the difference between the triplet and singlet
scattering lengths of H atoms, $a_t-a_s=30(5)$ pm, is exactly twice smaller

quantum stationary states formed in the gravitational field of the Earth
indicates a need to examine in more detail the general theoretical properties
of gravitational eigenstates. Despite the almost universal study of quantum
theory applied to atomic and molecular states very little work has been done to
investigate the properties of the hypothetical stationary states that should
exist in similar types of gravitational central potential wells, particularly
those with large quantum numbers. In this first of a series of papers, we
attempt to address this shortfall by developing analytic, non-integral
expressions for the electromagnetic dipole state-to-state transition rates of
charged particles for any given initial and final gravitational quantum states.
The expressions are non-relativistic and hence valid provided the eigenstate
wavefunctions do not extend significantly into regions of strong gravity. The
formulae may be used to obtain tractable approximations to the transition rates
that can be used to give general trends associated with certain types of
transitions. Surprisingly, we find that some of the high angular momentum
eigenstates have extremely long lifetimes and a resulting stability that belies
the multitude of channels available for state decay.

the polar spreads of the angular components of the high-n, high-l eigenstates
and the effects these have on the limiting values of the angular components of
the dipole matrix elements in the case of large l and m and (2) investigation
of the rapid cut off and limited width of the low-p, high-n radial
eigenfunctions, and the development of an equation to determine the width,
position and oscillatory behaviour of those eigenfunctions in cases of
arbitrarily large values of n, l and p. The methods have wider applicability
than dipole transition rate estimates and may be also used to determine limits
on the rates for more general interactions. Combining the methods enables the
establishment of upper limits to the total dipole decay rates of many high-n,
low-p states on the state diagram to be determined, even those that have many
channels available for decay. The results continue to support the hypothetical
existence of a specialized set of high-n, low-p gravitational eigenfunctions

With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it

GQ$(2,4)$, well-known to finite geometers; these are the ""doily"" (i. e.
GQ$(2,2)$) with 15, the ""perp-set"" of a point with 11, and the ""grid"" (i. e.
GQ$(2,1)$) with 9 points, respectively. In order to obtain the correct signs

the points of GQ$(2,4)$. For the 40 different possible truncations with 9

levels in a large isolated quantum system, where all possible superpositions of
eigenstates are allowed, provided all these superpositions have the same fixed
energy. Such a condition is not equivalent to the conventional micro-canonical
condition, because the latter limits the participating eigenstates to a very
narrow energy window. The statistics is obtained analytically for both the
entire system and its small subsystem. In a significant departure from the
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, the average occupation numbers of quantum states
exhibit in the present case weak algebraic dependence on energy. In the
macroscopic limit, this dependence is routinely accompanied by the condensation
into the lowest energy quantum state. This work contains initial numerical
tests of the above statistics for finite systems, and also reports the
following numerical finding: When the basis states of large but finite random
matrix Hamiltonians are expanded in terms of eigenstates, the participation of
eigenstates in such an expansion obeys the newly obtained statistics. The above
statistics might be observable in small quantum systems, but for the
macroscopic systems, it rather reenforces doubts about self-sufficiency of
non-relativistic quantum mechanics for justifying the Boltzmann-Gibbs

communication distances. The quantum carry-lookahead adder is faster than a
quantum ripple-carry adder; QCLA has logarithmic depth while ripple adders have
linear depth. MBQCLA utilizes MBQC's ability to transfer quantum states in unit

"536","Realizing singlet-triplet qubits in multivalley Si quantum dots","Dimitrie Culcer|Lukasz Cywinski|Qiuzi Li|Xuedong Hu|S. Das Sarma","  There has been significant progress in the implementation and manipulation of
singlet-triplet qubits in GaAs quantum dots. Given the considerably longer spin
coherence times measured in Si, considerable interest has been generated
recently in Si quantum dots. The physics of these systems is considerably more
complex than the physics of GaAs quantum dots owing to the presence of the
valley degree of freedom, which constitutes the focus of this work. In this
paper we investigate the physics of Si quantum dots and focus on the
feasibility of quantum coherent singlet-triplet qubit experiments analogous to
those performed in GaAs. This additional degree of freedom greatly increases
the complexity of the ground state and gives rise to highly nontrivial and
interesting physics in the processes of qubit initialization, coherent
manipulation and readout. We discuss the operational definition of a qubit in
Si-based quantum dots. We find that in the presence of valley degeneracy a
singlet-triplet qubit cannot be constructed, whereas for large valley splitting
(>>k_B*T) the experiment is similar to GaAs. We show that experiments on
singlet-triplet qubits analogous to those in GaAs would provide a method for
estimating the valley coupling in Si. A Zeeman field distinguishes between
different initialized states for any valley splitting and provides a tool to
determine the size of this splitting.

Casimir-Polder interactions in systems involving conducting plates has
attracted considerable attention in the recent literature on dispersion forces.
Alternative theoretical models, based on distinct low-frequency extrapolations
of the plates reflection coefficient for transverse electric (TE) modes,
provide widely different predictions for the magnitude of this correction. In
this paper we examine the most widely used prescriptions for this reflection
coefficient from the point of view of their consistency with the Bohr-van
Leeuwen theorem of classical statistical physics, stating that at thermal
equilibrium transverse electromagnetic fields decouple from matter in the
classical limit. We find that the theorem is satisfied if and only if the TE
reflection coefficient vanishes at zero frequency in the classical limit. This
criterion appears to rule out some of the models that have been considered
recently for describing the thermal correction to the Casimir pressure with
non-magnetic metallic plates.

We show how the SRS depends on geometric factors such as the Fresnel number and
the optical depth, and that in fact these two factors are the only factors

  Computing","Cyril Gavoille|Adrian Kosowski|Marcin Markiewicz","  Recently, several claims have been made that certain fundamental problems of
distributed computing, including Leader Election and Distributed Consensus,
begin to admit feasible and efficient solutions when the model of distributed
computation is extended so as to apply quantum processing. This has been
achieved in one of two distinct ways: (1) by initializing the system in a
quantum entangled state, and/or (2) by applying quantum communication channels.
In this paper, we explain why some of these prior claims are misleading, in the
sense that they rely on changes to the model unrelated to quantum processing.
On the positive side, we consider the aforementioned quantum extensions when
applied to Linial's well-established LOCAL model of distributed computing.
  For both types of extensions, we put forward valid proof-of-concept examples
of distributed problems whose round complexity is in fact reduced through
genuinely quantum effects, in contexts which do not depend on the anonymity of
nodes.
  Finally, we show that even the quantum variants of the LOCAL model have
non-trivial limitations, captured by a very simple (purely probabilistic)
notion which we call ""physical locality"" (PLOCAL). While this is strictly
weaker than the ""computational locality"" of the classical LOCAL model, it
nevertheless implies that for many distributed combinatorial optimization
problems, such as Maximal Independent Set, the best currently known lower time
bounds cannot be broken by applying quantum processing, in any conceivable way.

single-photon scheme in which an entangled single-photon state serves the
quantum channel to generate entangled distant BECs. The other is a multiphoton
scheme where an entangled coherent state of the probe lasers is used as the

violation of the weak equivalence principle. Explicit expressions for these
contributions are shown for the case of quasi-circular orbital motion of a

effects coupled to the Zitterbewegung frequency. As well, the choice of

both effects on cavity cooling and find that for a small laser linewidth the
dominant heating mechanism arises from intensity fluctuations. The resulting

path of nondegenerate eigenstates of a continuous family of Hamiltonians. We
introduce a method that traverses a discretized form of the path: At each step
we apply the instantaneous Hamiltonian for a random time. The resulting
decoherence approximates a projective measurement onto the desired eigenstate,
achieving a version of the quantum Zeno effect. If negative evolution times can
be implemented with constant overhead, then the average absolute evolution time
required by our method is O(L^2/Delta) for constant error probability, where L
is the length of the path of eigenstates and Delta is the minimum spectral gap
of the Hamiltonian. Making explicit the dependence on the path length is useful
for cases where L does not depend on Delta. The complexity of our method has a
logarithmic improvement over previous algorithms of this type. The same cost
applies to the discrete-time case, where a family of unitary operators is given
and each unitary and its inverse can be used. Restriction to positive evolution
times incurs an error that decreases exponentially with the cost. Applications
of this method to unstructured search and quantum sampling are considered. In

  We show that the Ward-Takahashi identity allows the defining of general
temporal function in the frame of QED, real part of which describes the
duration of delay of scattered particle on scatterer and imaginary part
describes the duration of formation (""dressing"") of outgoing bare particle. The
functions of same form can be revealed in the known QED descriptions of

better understand which classes of problems they will find easy and which
others even they will find intractable. We study random ensembles of the
QMA$_1$-complete quantum satisfiability (QSAT) problem introduced by Bravyi.
QSAT appropriately generalizes the NP-complete classical satisfiability (SAT)
problem. We show that, as the density of clauses/projectors is varied, the
ensembles exhibit quantum phase transitions between phases that are satisfiable
and unsatisfiable. Remarkably, almost all instances of QSAT for any hypergraph
exhibit the same dimension of the satisfying manifold. This establishes the
QSAT decision problem as equivalent to a, potentially new, graph theoretic
problem and that the hardest typical instances are likely to be localized in a
bounded range of clause density.

complex potential of step function form. We concentrate on the limit of a weak
potential, in which the resulting arrival time distribution function is closely
related to the quantum-mechanical current. We first consider the analagous
classical arrival time problem involving an absorbing potential, and this sheds
some light on certain aspects of the quantum case. In the quantum case, we
review the path decomposition expansion (PDX), in which the propagator is
factored across a surface of constant time, so is very useful for potentials of
step function form. We use the PDX to derive the usual scattering wave
functions and the arrival time distribution function. This method gives a
direct and geometrically appealing account of known results (but also points
the way to how they can be extended to more general complex potentials). We use
these results to carry out a decoherent histories analysis of the arrival time
problem, taking advantage of a recently demonstrated connection between pulsed
measurements and complex potentials. We obtain very simple and plausible
expressions for the class operators (describing the amplitudes for crossing the
origin during intervals of time) and show that decoherence of histories is
obtained for a wide class of initial states (such as simple wave packets and
superpositions of wave packets). We find that the decoherent histories approach
gives results with a sensible classical limit that are fully compatible with
standard results on the arrival time problem. We also find some interesting

frequently emerges as the probability for crossing the origin during a given

semiclassically correct but can be negative due to backflow. Here, we show that
this formula naturally arises in a decoherent histories analysis of the arrival
time problem. For a variety of initial states, we show that histories crossing
during different time intervals are approximately decoherent. Probabilities may
therefore be assigned and coincide with the standard formula (in a
semiclassical approximation), which is therefore positive for these states.
However, for initial states for which there is backflow, we show that there
cannot be decoherence of histories, so probabilities may not be assigned.

quantitatively surpasses the uncertainty limit calculated from the quantum
Cramer-Rao inequality based on a magnetic coupling Hamiltonian with only
single-body operators. We also show that a quantum Kalman filter is
insufficient to obtain super-Heisenberg scaling, and present evidence that such

H. Bennett and G. Brassard in 1984 (BB84), describes how this is achieved by
transmitting individual qubits and exchanging classical authenticated
information. Any attempt to eavesdrop on the protocol introduces errors
detectable by the legitimate parties.
  This Licentiate Thesis studies the recently introduced EEQKD protocol which
builds on BB84. In EEQKD, the qubits sent individually in BB84 are entangled
and thus not directly available to an eavesdropper who is, in this protocol,
provided only one-by-one access to the transmission. The maximal information an
eavesdropper can gain using a straightforward intercept-resend (IR) attack, is
obtained for a given error rate. The secure key generation rate of EEQKD is
estimated in practical scenarios including qubit loss and quantum channel
noise. In addition, an exquisite vulnerability is exposed: For a particular
setting of qubit entanglement, paradoxically proving most useful in the face of
an IR attack, EEQKD reduces to BB84.

decay function for the off-diagonal peaks of the density matrix, which applies
both to a common and separate reservoirs. We have also identified the expected

  states in multimode cavity QED","Sarang Gopalakrishnan|Benjamin L. Lev|Paul M. Goldbart","  We propose that condensed matter phenomena involving the spontaneous
emergence and dynamics of crystal lattices can be realized in the setting of
ultracold Bose-condensed atoms coupled to multimode cavities. Previously, it
was shown that in the case of a transversely pumped single-mode cavity, the
atoms self-organize at either the even or the odd antinodes of the cavity mode,
given sufficient pump intensity, and hence spontaneously break a discrete
translational symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that in multimode cavities the
self-organization brings the additional feature of continuous translational
symmetry breaking, via a variant of Brazovskii's transition, thus paving the
way for realizations of compliant lattices and associated phenomena, e.g.,
quantum melting, topological defects, frustration, glassiness, and even
supersolidity; such phenomena are absent in ultracold atomic systems when the
optical lattices are externally imposed. We apply a functional integral
approach to this many-body cavity QED system, which enables us, inter alia, to
calculate transition thresholds, explore fluctuations near this transition, and
determine how such fluctuations are manifest in the light emitted from the
cavity.

  nuclear spin bath coupled by long-range hyperfine-mediated interactions","L. Cywinski|W. M. Witzel|S. Das Sarma","  We investigate decoherence due to pure dephasing of a localized spin qubit
interacting with a nuclear spin bath. Although in the limit of a very large
magnetic field the only decoherence mechanism is spectral diffusion due to
dipolar flip-flops of nuclear spins, with decreasing field the
hyperfine-mediated interactions between the nuclear spins become important. We
take advantage of their long-range nature, and resum the leading terms in an
1/N expansion of the decoherence time-evolution function (N, being the number
of nuclear spins interacting appreciably with the electron spin, is large). For
the case of the thermal uncorrelated bath we show that our theory is applicable
down to low magnetic fields (~10 mT for a large dot with N=10^6) allowing for
comparison with recent experiments in GaAs quantum dot spin qubits. Within this
approach we calculate the free induction decay and spin echo decoherence in
GaAs and InGaAs as a function of the number of the nuclei in the bath (i.e. the
quantum dot size) and the magnetic field. Our theory for free induction decay
in a narrowed nuclear bath is shown to agree with the exact solution for
decoherence due to hyperfine-mediated interaction which can be obtained when
all the nuclei-electron coupling constants are identical. For the spin echo
evolution we show that the dominant decoherence process at low fields is due to
interactions between nuclei having significantly different Zeeman energies
(i.e. nuclei of As and two isotopes of Ga in GaAs), and we compare our results
with recent measurements of spin echo signal of a single spin confined in a
GaAs quantum dot. For the same set of parameters we perform calculations of
decoherence under various dynamical decoupling pulse sequences, and predict the
effect of these sequences in low B regime in GaAs.

means that the state of the system approaches an equilibrium state, the latter
depending only on macroscopic characteristics of the bath (e.g. temperature),
but not on the initial state of the system. The above statement is the
cornerstone of the equilibrium statistical mechanics; its validity and its
domain of applicability are central questions in the studies of the foundations
of statistical mechanics. In the present paper we concentrate on one aspect of
thermalization, namely, on the system initial state independence (ISI) of the
equilibrium state. A necessary condition for the system ISI is derived in the
quantum framework. We use the derived condition to prove the absence of the
system ISI in a specific model. Namely, we consider a single spin coupled to a
large bath, the interaction being of a specific form. Although the model under
consideration is nontrivial enough to exhibit the decoherence and the approach
to equilibrium, the derived necessary condition is not fulfilled and thus the
equilibrium state depends on the initial state of the spin.

quantum scattering: the stationary phase method and its relation with delay
times for relativistic and non-relativistic tunneling particles. We notice that
the applicability of this method is constrained by several subtleties in
deriving the phase time that describes the localization of scattered wave
packets. We investigate the general relation between phase times and dwell
times for quantum tunneling/scattering. Considering a symmetrical collision of
two identical wave packets with an one-dimensional barrier, we demonstrate that
these two distinct transit time definitions are explicitly connected. The
traversal times are obtained for a symmetrized (two identical bosons) and an
antisymmetrized (two identical fermions) quantum colliding configuration.
Multiple wave packet decomposition shows us that the phase time (group delay)
describes the exact position of the scattered particles and, in addition to the
exact relation with the dwell time, leads to correct conceptual understanding
of both transit time definitions. At last, we extend the non-relativistic
formalism to the solutions for the tunneling zone of a one-dimensional
electrostatic potential in the relativistic (Dirac to Klein-Gordon) wave
equation where the incoming wave packet exhibits the possibility of being
almost totally transmitted through the potential barrier. The conditions for

complexes. A theoretical model is constructed yielding the local value of the
Lyapunov characteristic number in a scattering event, which scales as an
inverse power of the speed of the nodal point in the rest frame, or
proportionally to the size of the nodal point X- point complex. The results of
detailed numerical experiments with different wavefunctions possessing multiple

of each orbit with the nodal point X-point complexes. Various phenomena

using a new many-body approach. Extending number-states to composite bosons,
two-particle correlations as well as the dispersion of the probability
distribution are analyzed. We show that the particle composite nature reduces
the anti-bunching effect predicted for elementary bosons. Furthermore, the
probability distribution exhibits a dispersion which is greater for composite
bosons than for elementary bosons. This dispersion corresponds to the one of
sub-Poissonian processes, as for a quantum state, but, unlike its elementary
boson counterpart, it is not minimum. In general, our work shows that it is
necessary to take into account the Pauli exclusion principle which takes place
between fermionic components of composite bosons - along the line here used -

allows quantum rewinding for protocols of a certain form. We then discuss two
applications. First, the combination of coin-flipping with any non-interactive
zero-knowledge protocol leads to an easy transformation from non-interactive
zero-knowledge to interactive quantum zero-knowledge. Second, we discuss how
our protocol can be applied to a recently proposed method for improving the
security of quantum protocols [DFL+09], resulting in an implementation without
set-up assumptions. Finally, we sketch how to achieve efficient simulation for
an extended construction in the common-reference-string model.

proposed. Alice uses spontaneous parametric down-conversion to send Bob a set
of signal modes over a pure-loss channel while retaining the set of idler modes
with which they are maximally entangled. Bob imposes a single information bit
on the modes he receives from Alice via binary phase-shift keying. He then adds
classical Gaussian noise and sends the noisy modulated modes back to Alice over
the same pure-loss channel. Even though the loss and noise destroy any
entanglement between the modes that Alice receives from Bob and the idler modes
she has retained, she can decode Bob's bit with an error probability that can
be orders of magnitude lower than what is achieved by a passive eavesdropper
who receives all the photons that are lost en route from Alice to Bob and from
Bob to Alice.

that vacuum squeezing is corrupted by incoherent processes (such as spontaneous

specific small region of the experimental parameter space. Numerical
simulations, in good agreement with the experiment, demonstrate that the two
excited state hyperfine levels play a crucial role in the squeezing and excess
noise production. The significant influence of far-detuned atoms on the field
fluctuations at low noise frequencies imposes the explicit consideration of the

certainly correct. It is remarkable, however, that the entire structure-from
the mass, spin and charge labels on particlelike states to antisymmetry to
broken internal symmetries to gauge transformations to the equations of
motion-is built upon concepts from group representation theory. That is, the
theory is constructed exactly as if it were a representational form of an
underlying theory. Our proposed form for the underlying theory is that it is
based on a linear equation, OF(V)=0. F is a function of some set of
independent, currently unknown variables V, with O being a linear, partial
differential operator in those variables. The operator is assumed to be
invariant under a group of transformations of the Vs, homomorphic to the direct
product of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group and the internal symmetry group. In
such a theory, a state vector, denoted by a ket with group-theoretic labels,
would represent a function of the independent variables. In addition to
explaining the group representational structure of quantum mechanics, an
underlying theory offers insight into gauge theory.

energy transfer one has to leave the classical, master-equation-type formalism
and advance towards an increasingly quantum-mechanical picture, while still
retaining a local description of the complex network of molecules involved in
the transport, say through a tight-binding approach.
  Interestingly, the continuous time random walk (CTRW) picture, widely
employed in describing transport in random environments, can be mathematically
reformulated to yield a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of tight-binding type;
the procedure uses the mathematical analogies between time-evolution operators
in statistical and in quantum mechanics: The result are continuous-time quantum
walks (CTQWs). However, beyond these formal analogies, CTRWs and CTQWs display
vastly different physical properties. In particular, here we focus on trapping
processes on a ring and show, both analytically and numerically, that distinct
configurations of traps (ranging from periodical to random) yield strongly
different behaviours for the quantal mean survival probability, while
classically (under ordered conditions) we always find an exponential decay at

asymptotic limit, considering the exclusive case of the dominant final state of

dominant intra-shell carrelations, which had been reported earlier, can be
understood utilizing the closure properties satisfied by the eigen functions of
the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian. Considering the sum of correlations with all
states, occupied or not, we show that complete sum is equal to the contribution
of the high energy part of the continuum. Consequently there is a total
cancellation between the contributions of the bound states and the low energy
part of the continuum states. This means that the real correlations in the
physical atom can be obtained as the negative of the total contribution of low
energy states and continuum unoccupied states. We calculate this in framework
of the quantum defect number. The approach allows us to see that the dominant
intrashell correlation is going to be cancelled. We can also obtain some limits
on the correlation effects by considering calculations with the screened

Therefore we can assume that a nuclear collective degree of freedom would get
classicality when it couples with any other internal degrees of freedom. In

working principle of the detectors is described together with the analysis
procedures employed to extract the photon shot noise of light pulses with

approach allows for broadband quantum noise measurements. The equivalent noise
charge (ENC) for two different hardware approaches is evaluated to 280 and 340
electrons per pulse, respectively which corresponds to a dark noise equivalent
photon number of $n_\mathrm{3dB}=0.8\cdot 10^5$ and $n_\mathrm{3dB}=1.2\cdot

then propose a new protocol that is capable of achieving secure QDC with

uses the quantum Bell states, and applies unitary transformations in the
authentication process. Then it exploits and utilizes the entanglement swapping

authentication process, the client users are left alone to communicate with
each other, and the authenticator has no access to the secrete message. In
addition, our protocol does not require a direct quantum link between any two
users, who want to communicate with each other. This may also be an appealing
advantage in the implementation of a practical quantum communication network.

a finite degree of entanglement. This phenomenon occurs only in a certain

noise photons are returned to the receiver in its absence. This model
facilitates us to obtain analytic results on error-probability bounds i.e., the

enhanced sensitivity than the photon number state system, when average signal
photon number is small compared to the thermal noise level. However, in the
high signal-to-noise scenario, N00N states fail to be advantageous than the

conventional coherent state system surpasses the performance sensitivity

qubits, outputs a set of output qubits and updated memory qubits, and feeds the
memory back into the device for the next cycle (similar to the operation of a
classical shift register). Such a device finds application as an encoding and
decoding circuit for a particular type of quantum error-correcting code, called
a quantum convolutional code. Building on the Ollivier-Tillich and
Grassl-Roetteler encoding algorithms for quantum convolutional codes, I present
a method to determine a quantum shift register encoding circuit for a quantum
convolutional code. I also determine a formula for the amount of memory that a
CSS quantum convolutional code requires. I then detail primitive quantum shift
register circuits that realize all of the finite- and infinite-depth
transformations in the shift-invariant Clifford group (the class of
transformations important for encoding and decoding quantum convolutional
codes). The memory formula for a CSS quantum convolutional code then
immediately leads to a formula for the memory required by a CSS
entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional code.

characteristic de Broglie periodicities as constraints. In analogy with finite
temperature field theory and with extra-dimensional field theories, this
compactification naturally leads to a quantized energy spectrum. As a
consequence of the relation between periodicity and energy arising from the de
Broglie relation, the compactification must be regarded as dynamical and local.
The theory, whose fundamental set-up is presented in this paper, turns out to
be consistent with special relativity and in particular respects causality. The
non trivial classical dynamics of these periodic fields show remarkable
overlaps with ordinary quantum field theory. This can be interpreted as a
generalization of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

obtain the right order of magnitude. The improvement results from a
renormalized superposition of the probability amplitudes describing short and
long exponential decays. The renormalization occurs because the amplitudes that
we are dealing with are associated to the decay rate, and not to the integrated
decay rate or survival probability as is usually the case in standard

usual QKD, the security of DIQKD follows from the laws of quantum physics, but
contrary to usual QKD, it does not rely on any assumptions about the internal
working of the quantum devices used in the protocol. We present here in detail
the security proof for a DIQKD protocol introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98,
230501 (2008)]. This proof exploits the full structure of quantum theory (as
opposed to other proofs that exploit the no-signalling principle only), but
only holds again collective attacks, where the eavesdropper is assumed to act
on the quantum systems of the honest parties independently and identically at
each round of the protocol (although she can act coherently on her systems at
any time). The security of any DIQKD protocol necessarily relies on the
violation of a Bell inequality. We discuss the issue of loopholes in Bell

  ordered phase","Alioscia Hamma|Daniel A. Lidar|Simone Severini","  Quantum systems with short range interactions are known to respect an area
law for the entanglement entropy: the von Neumann entropy $S$ associated to a
bipartition scales with the boundary $p$ between the two parts. Here we study
the case in which the boundary is a fractal. We consider the topologically
ordered phase of the toric code with a magnetic field. When the field vanishes
it is possible to analytically compute the entanglement entropy for both
regular and fractal bipartitions $(A,B)$ of the system, and this yields an
upper bound for the entire topological phase. When the $A$-$B$ boundary is
regular we have $S/p =1$ for large $p$. When the boundary is a fractal of
Hausdorff dimension $D$, we show that the entanglement between the two parts
scales as $S/p=\gamma\leq1/D$, and $\gamma$ depends on the fractal considered.

projective representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. However,
Wigner's formulation makes no mention of the Weyl-Heisenberg group and the

and noncommutative structure arises directly because the quantum phase requires
projective representations. We then consider the relativistic implications of
the quantum phase that lead to the Born line element and the projective
representations of an inhomogeneous unitary group that defines a noninertial
quantum theory. (Understanding noninertial quantum mechanics is a prelude to
understanding quantum gravity.) The remarkable properties of this symmetry and

two published reports, one of which reported quantum localization, while the
other reported diffusion. The classical systems are chaotic, and exhibit normal
diffusive behavior. In the quantum systems, we found different regimes,
depending on the strength of the coupling. For weak coupling, we found quantum
localization similar to that exhibited by single kicked rotors. For strong
coupling, we found a quasi-diffusive growth of the width of the momentum
distribution, in which the apparent diffusion coefficient decreased as time
increased. The behavior in this regime can be described by the scaling theory
of weak localization for two-dimensional disordered lattices. The weak and
strong coupling regimes are separated by a regime of complex intermediate
behavior. Thus we explain the apparent contradiction in the literature as being
due to qualitatively different regimes of behavior, which we call strong and

nuclear polarization (DNP), as it exhibits a continuum of properties from
metallic to insulating as a function of doping concentration and temperature.
At low doping concentrations DNP has been observed to occur via the solid
effect, while at very high doping concentrations an Overhauser mechanism is
responsible. Here we report the hyperpolarization of 29Si in n-doped silicon
crystals, with doping concentrations in the range of 1-3 x 10^17 /cc. In this
regime exchange interactions between donors become extremely important. The
sign of the enhancement in our experiments and its frequency dependence suggest
that the 29Si spins are directly polarized by donor electrons via an Overhauser
mechanism within exchange-coupled donor clusters. The exchange interaction
between donors only needs to be larger than the silicon hyperfine interaction
(typically much smaller than the donor hyperfine coupling) to enable this
Overhauser mechanism. Nuclear polarization enhancement is observed for a range
of donor clusters in which the exchange energy is comparable to the donor
hyperfine interaction. The DNP dynamics are characterized by a single
exponential time constant that depends on the microwave power, indicating that
the Overhauser mechanism is the rate-limiting step. Since only about 2 % of the
silicon nuclei are located within one Bohr radius of the donor electron,
nuclear spin diffusion is important in transferring the polarization to all the
spins. However, the spin-diffusion time is much shorter than the Overhauser
time due to the relatively weak silicon hyperfine coupling strength. In a 2.35
T magnetic field at 1.1 K, we observed a DNP enhancement of $244 +/- 84
resulting in a silicon polarization of $10.4 +/- 3.4 % following two hours of
microwave irradiation.

universe may be so large that any laboratory, no matter how precisely it is

separated copies throughout the vast universe. In this case, no observer within
the universe can distinguish all possible outcomes for all copies of the
laboratory. Then normalized probabilities for the local outcomes that can be
locally distinguished cannot be given by the expectation values of any

demonstrate that the general classical upper bounds given by Ji et al. are

the actual classical upper bound for d less than or equal to 13 (including
non-prime values of d). We further determine that for prime value d in this
range, most of these probability and correlation inequalities are tight, i.e.,
facet-inducing for the respective classical correlation polytope. Stronger

  locality The principles of a revolution of epistemology revealed in the
  descriptions of microstates","Mioara Mugur-Schachter","  This is an improved remake of a previous work submitted with the same title.
An epistemologicalphysical, strictly qualitative discipline, IQM (infra-quantum
mechanics), is constructed independently of the mathematical formalism of QM.
IQM emerges under exclusively the constraints imposed by: the cognitive
situation of a human being who decides to construct communicable and consensual
knowledge on microstates; general requirements of human conceptualization. IMQ
brings into evidence how the mathematical formalism of QM manages to signify.
It explicates an integrated expression of a radically new type of descriptional
form, transferred on the registering devices of macroscopic apparatuses and
primordially statistical. IMQ is then considered globally and its relations
with space, time, geometry, consensus, as well as with Einstein's theories, are
specified. It appears that: there exists an order of progressive
constructability of our conceptualizations of physical reality; this order
withstands inclusion of concepts constructed inside macroscopic physics, into
the primordial transferred representation of microstates; consequently the aim
of directly unifying Einstein's theories, with QM, appears to be impossible.
Bell's theorem on locality expresses exclusively this impossibility. Causality
appears to be a modelizing concept that cannot be implemented into our
primordial representations of physical entities.

Groblacher et al. called that non-local realism and tried to prove that it is
still contradicted by the quantum theory.The present text analyses the
consistency of the concept of non-local realism, before questioning whether the
experiment contradicts it or not. The realism supposes that macroscopic
apparatuses don't enforce one result or another in measurements, but only
reveal pre-existent values of properties of the measured systems. However, it
is shown here that if factors situated at a distance from a system are assumed
to influence the system response to measurements, the wave function may be not
unique. It's the macroscopic objects that pick one wave function from the
different possible wave functions. So, their influence on the results cannot be

measures reveals the 'kind' of entanglement, i.e. if it is bipartite,
tripartite, ..., n-partite entangled and is denoted as the 'physical' measure.
We show how lower bounds on both sets of measures can be obtained by the
observation that any entropy may be rewritten via operational expressions known
as m-concurrences. Moreover, for different classes of bipartite or multipartite

quantum optical operations pertaining to the Continuous Variable (CV) quantum
teleportation protocol for general resource and input states is introduced;
allowing for modifications of basic CV teleportation; such as lossy homodyne
measurements and the presence of thermal noise. The output state CF is given as
a product of the CFs of resource and input. The use of non-Gaussian resources
is studied by means of a general class of two-mode squeezed Bell-like states
that include as special cases Gaussian, non-Gaussian and ""degaussified""
resources; it is shown that Bell-like resources optimized (""tailored"") for
maximum fidelity yield a remarkable improvement in fidelity of teleportation
for the studied input states. A further generalization is introduced with
two-mode squeezed superpositions of Fock states including finite truncations of
Gaussian states as special cases; it is shown that the optimization for maximum
fidelity reduces these resources to truncated Gaussian states. Another class of
non-Gaussian resources is introduced, optimized squeezed cat-like states; their
performance is shown to be higher than that of a Gaussian state; but lower than
that for the Bell-like states. It is shown that the optimal non-Gaussian
resources are those that most closely realize the simultaneous maximization of
the entanglement, the affinity with the two-mode squeezed vacuum and the
(suitably measured) amount of non-Gaussianity. The teleportation of coherent
state inputs is studied using squeezed Bell-like and squeezed cat-like states
superimposed over Gaussian modes representing thermal noise; it is shown that
the optimized non-Gaussian resources are more robust in the presence of noise
then Gaussian resources.

"640","Quantum vacuum effects from boundaries of designer potentials","Tomasz Konopka","  Vacuum energy in quantum field theory, being the sum of zero-point energies
of all field modes, is formally infinite but yet, after regularization or
renormalization, can give rise to finite observable effects. One way of
understanding how these effects arise is to compute the vacuum energy in an
idealized system such as a large cavity divided into disjoint regions by
pistons. In this paper, this type of calculation is carried out for situations
where the potential affecting a field is not the same in all regions of the
cavity. It is shown that the observable parts of the vacuum energy in such
potentials do not fall off to zero as the region where the potential is
nontrivial becomes large. This unusual behavior might be interesting for tests
involving quantum vacuum effects and for studies on the relation between vacuum
energy in quantum field theory and geometry.

light in the uncompactified directions in the context of linearized quantum
gravity. We find that the flight times of pulses can fluctuate due to
modification of the graviton vacuum by the compactification. In the case of a
five dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory, the mean variation in flight time can
grow logarithmically with the flight distance. This effect is in principle
observable, but too small to serve as a realistic probe of the existence of
extra dimensions. We also examine the effect of the compactification on the
widths of spectral lines, and find that there is a small line narrowing effect.
This effect is also small for compactification well above the Planck scale, but
might serve as a test of the existence of extra dimensions.

rigorously examined the finite sample performance of the estimators and
associated methods of hypothesis testing. While ML is usually preferred on the
basis of its asymptotic properties - it achieves the Cramer-Rao (CR) lower
bound - the finite sample properties are often less than optimal. We compare
the asymptotic and finite-sample properties of the ML estimators and test
statistics for two different choices of measurement bases: the average case
optimal or mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and a representative set of suboptimal
bases, for spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems. We show that, in both cases, the
standard errors of the ML estimators sometimes do not contain the true value of
the parameter, which can render inference based on the asymptotic properties of
the ML unreliable for experimentally realistic sample sizes. The results
indicate that in order to fully exploit the information geometry of quantum
states and achieve smaller reconstruction errors, the use of Bayesian state
reconstruction methods - which, unlike frequentist methods, do not rely on

"7114","State-independent experimental test of quantum contextuality","G. Kirchmair|F. Zähringer|R. Gerritsma|M. Kleinmann|O. Gühne|A. Cabello|R. Blatt|C. F. Roos","  The question of whether quantum phenomena can be explained by classical
models with hidden variables is the subject of a long lasting debate. In 1964,
Bell showed that certain types of classical models cannot explain the quantum
mechanical predictions for specific states of distant particles. Along this
line, some types of hidden variable models have been experimentally ruled out.
An intuitive feature for classical models is non-contextuality: the property
that any measurement has a value which is independent of other compatible
measurements being carried out at the same time. However, the results of
Kochen, Specker, and Bell show that non-contextuality is in conflict with
quantum mechanics. The conflict resides in the structure of the theory and is
independent of the properties of special states. It has been debated whether
the Kochen-Specker theorem could be experimentally tested at all. Only
recently, first tests of quantum contextuality have been proposed and
undertaken with photons and neutrons. Yet these tests required the generation
of special quantum states and left various loopholes open. Here, using trapped
ions, we experimentally demonstrate a state-independent conflict with
non-contextuality. The experiment is not subject to the detection loophole and
we show that, despite imperfections and possible measurement disturbances, our
results cannot be explained in non-contextual terms.

fact, atom entanglement can revive before, simultaneously or even after the
disentanglement of reservoirs. Using a novel method based on the population

  (II): Direct test of uniqueness of vacuum","Marcin Wilczewski|Marek Czachor","  The paper continues the analysis of vacuum Rabi oscillations we started in
Part I [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 79}, 033836 (2009)]. Here we concentrate on
experimental consequences for cavity QED of two different classes of
representations of harmonic oscillator Lie algebras. The zero-temperature
master equation, derived in Part I for irreducible representations of the
algebra, is reformulated in a reducible representation that models
electromagnetic fields by a gas of harmonic oscillator wave packets. The
representation is known to introduce automatic regularizations that in
irreducible representations would have to be justified by ad hoc arguments.
Predictions based on this representation are characterized in thermodynamic
limit by a single parameter $\varsigma$, responsible for collapses and revivals
of Rabi oscillations in exact vacuum. Collapses and revivals disappear in the
limit $\varsigma\to\infty$. Observation of a finite $\varsigma$ would mean that
cavity quantum fields are described by a non-Wightmanian theory, where vacuum
states are zero-temperature Bose-Einstein condensates of a finite-particle
bosonic oscillator gas and, thus, are non-unique. The data collected in the
experiment of Brune {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{76}}, 1800 (1996)] are
consistent with any $\varsigma>400$.

the modulation regardless of the particular technical implementation. As the
trusted preparation noise is shown to be security breaking even for purely
lossy channels, we reveal the essential difference between two types of trusted
noise, namely sender-side preparation noise and receiver-side detection noise,
the latter being security preserving. We consider the method of sender-side
state purification to compensate the preparation noise and show its
applicability in the realistic conditions of channel loss, untrusted channel
excess noise, and trusted detection noise. We show that purification makes the
scheme robust to the preparation noise (i.e., even the arbitrary noisy coherent
states can in principle be used for the purpose of quantum key distribution).
We also take into account the effect of realistic reconciliation and show that
the purification method is still efficient in this case up to a limited value

demonstrated and studied, as an appropriate amplitude modulation to a single
pulse can expand its spectrum and thus increase the utilization efficiency of
the bandwidth of a slow light system. In a single-$\Lambda$ type
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) system, the slowed AMG pulse
experiences severe distortion, mainly owing to the frequency dependent
transmission of medium. Additionally, due to its spectral distribution, the
frequency dependent dispersion of the medium causes simultaneous slow and fast
light of different spectral components and thus a certain dispersive distortion
of the AMG pulse. Further, a post-processing method is proposed to recover the
slowed (distorted) pulse, which indicates that by introducing a linear optical
system with a desired gain spectrum we can recover the pulse in an
""all-optical"" way. Finally, we discuss the limitations during this compensation

Frobenius algebras with some additional properties. They express the
distinguishing capabilities of classical data: in contrast with quantum data,
classical data can be copied and deleted. The algebraic approach thus shifts
the paradigm of ""quantization"" of a classical theory to ""classicization"" of a

conceptual shift, but even allows us to distinguish the deterministic classical
operations (i.e. functions) from the nondeterministic classical operations

"350","Absorbing boundary conditions for dynamical many-body quantum systems","Sølve Selstø|Simen Kvaal","  In numerical studies of the dynamics of unbound quantum mechanical systems,
absorbing boundary conditions are frequently applied. Although this certainly
provides a useful tool in facilitating the description of the system, its
applications to systems consisting of more than one particle is problematic.
This is due to the fact that all information about the system is lost upon
absorption of one particle; a formalism based solely on the Scrh{\""o}dinger
equation is not able to describe the remainder of the system as particles are
lost. Here we demonstrate how the dynamics of a quantum system with a given
number of identical fermions may be described in a manner which allows for
particle loss. A consistent formalism which incorporates the evolution of
sub-systems with a reduced number of particles is constructed through the
Lindblad equation. Specifically, the transition from an $N$-particle system to
an $(N-1)$-particle system due to a complex absorbing potential is achieved by
relating the Lindblad operators to annihilation operators. The method allows
for a straight forward interpretation of how many constituent particles have
left the system after interaction. We illustrate the formalism using
one-dimensional two-particle model problems.

  theory-based analysis of financial crises","Matthias Hanauske|Jennifer Kunz|Steffen Bernius|Wolfgang König","  The last financial and economic crisis demonstrated the dysfunctional
long-term effects of aggressive behaviour in financial markets. Yet,
evolutionary game theory predicts that under the condition of strategic
dependence a certain degree of aggressive behaviour remains within a given
population of agents. However, as the consequences of the financial crisis
exhibit, it would be desirable to change the 'rules of the game' in a way that
prevents the occurrence of any aggressive behaviour and thereby also the danger
of market crashes. The paper picks up this aspect. Through the extension of the
in literature well-known Hawk-Dove game by a quantum approach, we can show that
dependent on entanglement, also evolutionary stable strategies can emerge,
which are not predicted by classical evolutionary game theory and where the
total economic population uses a non aggressive quantum strategy.

calculating the electromagnetic stress tensor, using the method employed by

from the quantum vacuum and from the thermal radiation; both of these

periodic driving, the response may exhibit exotic freezing behavior in high
driving frequency ($\omega$) regime. In a periodically driven classical
thermodynamic system, freezing at high $\omega$ occurs when $1/\omega$ is much
smaller than the characteristic relaxation time of the system, and hence the
freezing always increases there as $\omega$ is increased. Here, in the
contrary, we see surprising non-monotonic freezing behavior of the response
with $\omega$, showing curious peak-valley structure. Quite interestingly, the
entire system tends to freeze almost absolutely (the freezing peaks) when
driven with a certain combination of driving parameters values (amplitude and
$\omega$) due to coherent suppression of dynamics of the quantum many-body
modes, which has no classical analog. We demonstrate this new freezing
phenomenon analytically (supported by large-scale numerics) for a general class
of integrable quantum spin systems.

functions, such that a state describing n particles depends on n spacetime
positions. Since a general state is a superposition of states with different
numbers of particles, the wave function lives in the configuration space
identified with a product of an infinite number of 4-dimensional Minkowski
spacetimes. The squared absolute value of the wave function is interpreted as
the probability density in the configuration space, from which the standard
probabilistic predictions of QFT can be recovered. Such a formulation and
probabilistic interpretation of QFT allows to interpret the wave function as a
pilot wave that describes deterministic particle trajectories, which
automatically includes a deterministic and continuous description of particle
creation and destruction. In particular, when the conditional wave function
associated with a quantum measurement ceases to depend on one of the spacetime
coordinates, then the 4-velocity of the corresponding particle vanishes,
describing a trajectory that stops at a particular point in spacetime. In a
more general situation a dependence on this spacetime coordinate is negligibly
small but not strictly zero, in which case the trajectory does not stop but the
measuring apparatus still behaves as if this particle has been destroyed.

generation of single and multi-qubit states, procedures to synthesize unitary,

non-supervenient relations beyond the spatiotemporal ones is reinforced on a
foundational basis concerning constraints on the state-representation of
physical systems. Depending on the mode of assignment of states to physical

distinguish between strongly and weakly non-Humean, non-supervenient relations.
It is demonstrated that in either case the relations of quantum entanglement
constitute prototypical examples of irreducible physical relations that do not
supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of Humean qualities, weakening,
thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It is examined, in this respect,
the status of Lewis' recombination principle, whereas his conception of lawhood

  is nearly tight for every boolean function","Ben W. Reichardt","  The general adversary bound is a semi-definite program (SDP) that
lower-bounds the quantum query complexity of a function. We turn this lower
bound into an upper bound, by giving a quantum walk algorithm based on the dual
SDP that has query complexity at most the general adversary bound, up to a
logarithmic factor.
  In more detail, the proof has two steps, each based on ""span programs,"" a
certain linear-algebraic model of computation. First, we give an SDP that
outputs for any boolean function a span program computing it that has optimal
""witness size."" The optimal witness size is shown to coincide with the general
adversary lower bound. Second, we give a quantum algorithm for evaluating span
programs with only a logarithmic query overhead on the witness size.
  The first result is motivated by a quantum algorithm for evaluating composed
span programs. The algorithm is known to be optimal for evaluating a large
class of formulas. The allowed gates include all constant-size functions for
which there is an optimal span program. So far, good span programs have been
found in an ad hoc manner, and the SDP automates this procedure. Surprisingly,
the SDP's value equals the general adversary bound. A corollary is an optimal
quantum algorithm for evaluating ""balanced"" formulas over any finite boolean
gate set. The second result extends span programs' applicability beyond the
formula evaluation problem.
  A strong universality result for span programs follows. A good quantum query
algorithm for a problem implies a good span program, and vice versa. Although
nearly tight, this equivalence is nontrivial. Span programs are a promising
model for developing more quantum algorithms.

$\pi$-tangle in the real physical information process. For the model
calculation we adopt the three-party teleportation scheme through the various
noisy channels. The three parties consist of sender, accomplice and receiver.
It is shown that the $\pi$-tangles for the X- and Z-noisy channels vanish at
$\kappa t \to \infty$ limit, where $\kappa t$ is a parameter introduced in the
master equation of Lindblad form. In this limit the receiver's maximum fidelity
reduces to the classical limit 2/3. However, this nice feature is not
maintained at the Y- and isotropy-noise channels. For Y-noise channel the
$\pi$-tangle vanishes at $0.61 \leq \kappa t$. At $\kappa t = 0.61$ the
receiver's maximum fidelity becomes 0.57, which is much less than the classical
limit. Similar phenomenon occurs at the isotropic noise channel. We also
computed the three-tangles analytically for the X- and Z-noise channels. The
remarkable fact is that the three-tangle for Z-noise channel is exactly same
with the corresponding $\pi$-tangle. In the X-noise channel the three-tangle
vanishes at $0.10 \leq \kappa t$. At $\kappa t = 0.10$ the receiver's fidelity
can be reduced to the classical limit provided that the accomplice performs the
measurement appropriately. However, the receiver's maximum fidelity becomes
8/9, which is much larger than the classical limit. Since the Y- and
isotropy-noise channels are rank-8 mixed states, their three-tangles are not
computed explicitly. Instead, we have derived their upper bounds with use of
the analytical three-tangles for other noisy channels. Our analysis strongly
suggests that we need different three-party entanglement measure whose value is
between three-tangle and $\pi$-tangle.

of classical statistical physics. The property of a particle being ""classical""
or ""quantum"" ceases to be a basic conceptual difference. The dynamics differs,
however, between quantum and classical particles. We describe position, motion
and correlations of a quantum particle in terms of observables in a classical
statistical ensemble. On the other side, we also construct explicitly the
quantum formalism with wave function and Hamiltonian for classical particles.
For a suitable time evolution of the classical probabilities and a suitable
choice of observables all features of a quantum particle in a potential can be
derived from classical statistics, including interference and tunneling.
Besides conceptual advances, the treatment of classical and quantum particles
in a common formalism could lead to interesting cross-fertilization between
classical statistics and quantum physics.

particular, we focus on the case when the qubit Hamiltonian and the qubit's
operator being probed by the detector do not commute. Because the qubit's state
keeps evolving while being probed and because the measurement data is mixed
with a detector-related background noise, one might expect the detector to fail
in this case. We show, however, that under suitable conditions and by proper
analysis of the measurement data useful information about the state of the
qubit can be extracted. It turns out that the measurement basis is
stochastically determined every time the experiment is repeated. We analyze in
detail the probability distributions that govern the choice of measurement
bases. We also analyze the information acquisition rate and show that it is
largely unaffected by the apparent conflict between the measurement and
intrinsic qubit dynamics. We discuss the relation between our analysis and the
stochastic master equation that describes the evolution of the qubit's state

  the semiclassical propagator","Christoph-Marian Goletz|Frank Grossmann|Steven Tomsovic","  Quantized systems whose underlying classical dynamics possess an elaborate
mixture of regular and chaotic motion can exhibit rather subtle long-time
quantum transport phenomena. In a short wavelength regime where semiclassical
theories are most relevant, such transport phenomena, being quintessentially
interference based, are difficult to understand with the system's specific
long-time classical dynamics. Fortunately, semiclassical methods applied to
wave packet propagation can provide a natural approach to understanding the
connections, even though they are known to break down progressively as time
increases. This is due to the fact that some long-time transport properties can
be deduced from intermediate-time behavior. Thus, these methods need only
retain validity and be carried out on much shorter time scales than the
transport phenomena themselves in order to be valuable. The initial value
representation of the semiclassical propagator of Herman and Kluk [M. F. Herman
and E. Kluk, Chem. Phys. 91, 27 (1984)] is heavily used in a number of
molecular and atomic physics contexts, and is of interest here. It is known to
be increasingly challenging to implement as the underlying classical chaos
strengthens, and we ask whether it is possible to implement it well enough to
extract the kind of intermediate time information that reflects wave packet
localization at long times. Using a system of two coupled quartic oscillators,
we focus on the localizing effects of transport barriers formed by stable and
unstable manifolds in the chaotic sea and show that these effects can be
captured with the Herman-Kluk propagator.

we do not follow the standard approach which considers improper mixtures as

states: pure states and improper mixtures. This is done in order to overcome
one of the problems which appear in the standard quantum logical formalism,
namely, that for a subsystem of a larger system in an entangled state, the
conjunction of all actual properties of the subsystem does not yield its actual
state. In fact, its state is an improper mixture and cannot be represented in
the von Neumann lattice as a minimal property which determines all other
properties as is the case for pure states or classical systems. The new lattice
also contains all propositions of the von Neumann lattice. We argue that this

case- quantum interactions produce non trivial correlations between the
systems. Finally, we study the maps which can be defined between the extended

measurement if and only if there is a family of completely co--positive (ccP)
maps $C_\mu$ such that the probability of occurrence $Prob(\mu)$ is the
fidelity of the map $C_\mu$, i.e. $Prob(\mu)= Tr(\rho C_\mu(\rho))$ which must
add up to the fully depolarizing map. This implies that a POVM on two copies
induces a measure on the set of ccP maps (i.e., a ccPMVM). We present examples
of ccPMVM's and discuss their tomographic applications showing that two copies
of a state provide an exponential improvement in the efficiency of quantum
state tomography. This enables the existence of an efficient universal
detector.

  quantum computation","C. E. Mora|M. Piani|A. Miyake|M. Van den Nest|W. Dür|H. J. Briegel","  We investigate which quantum states can serve as universal resources for
approximate and stochastic measurement-based quantum computation, in the sense
that any quantum state can be generated from a given resource by means of
single-qubit (local) operations assisted by classical communication. More
precisely, we consider the approximate and stochastic generation of states,
resulting e.g. from a restriction to finite measurement settings or from
possible imperfections in the resources or local operations. We show that
entanglement-based criteria for universality obtained for the exact,
deterministic case can be lifted to the much more general approximate,
stochastic case, moving from the idealized situation considered in previous
works, to the practically relevant context of non-perfect state preparation. We
find that any entanglement measure fulfilling some basic requirements needs to
reach its maximum value on some element of an approximate, stochastic universal
family of resource states, as the resource size grows. This allows us to rule
out various families of states as being approximate, stochastic universal. We
provide examples of resources that are efficient approximate universal, but not
exact deterministic universal. We also study the robustness of universal
resources for measurement-based quantum computation under realistic assumptions
about the (imperfect) generation and manipulation of entangled states, giving
an explicit expression for the impact that errors made in the preparation of
the resource have on the possibility to use it for universal approximate and
stochastic state preparation. Finally, we discuss the relation between our
entanglement-based criteria and recent results regarding the uselessness of
states with a high degree of geometric entanglement as universal resources.

superfluidity, high temperature superconductors, multiple scattering by
molecular systems, molecular or atomic paracrystal structures, nanomaterials,
ferromagnetism in glassy materials, spin glasses, quantum phase transitions and

utilizes extended symmetries and quantum groupoid, algebroid and functorial
representations of non-Abelian higher dimensional structures pertinent to
quantized spacetime topology and state space geometry of quantum operator
algebras. Fourier transforms, generalized Fourier-Stieltjes transforms, and
duality relations link, respectively, the quantum groups and quantum groupoids
with their dual algebraic structures; quantum double constructions are also
discussed in this context in relation to quasi-triangular, quasi-Hopf algebras,
bialgebroids, Grassmann-Hopf algebras and higher dimensional algebra. On the

secrets is required for dealing with critical data and applications. Quantum
Cryptography (QC), in particular Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can answer that
need.
  The business white paper (BWP) summarizes how secret key establishment and
distribution problems can be solved by quantum cryptography. It deals with
several considerations related to how the quantum cryptography innovation could
contribute to provide business effectiveness. It addresses advantages and also
limitations of quantum cryptography, proposes a scenario case study, and
invokes standardization related issues. In addition, it answers most frequently
asked questions about quantum cryptography.

players, who in principle do not trust each other, wish to establish a common
random bit. If we limit ourselves to classical communication, this task
requires either assumptions on the computational power of the players or it
requires them to send messages to each other with sufficient simultaneity to
force their complete independence. Without such assumptions, all classical
protocols are so that one dishonest player has complete control over the
outcome. If we use quantum communication, on the other hand, protocols have
been introduced that limit the maximal bias that dishonest players can produce.
However, those protocols would be very difficult to implement in practice
because they are susceptible to realistic losses on the quantum channel between
the players or in their quantum memory and measurement apparatus. In this
paper, we introduce a novel quantum protocol and we prove that it is completely
impervious to loss. The protocol is fair in the sense that either player has
the same probability of success in cheating attempts at biasing the outcome of
the coin flip. We also give explicit and optimal cheating strategies for both
players.

the player a black box that, given an argument, evaluates the function. The

evaluation. This is the typical problem addressed by the quantum algorithms. In
former theoretical work, we showed that a quantum algorithm requires the number
of function evaluations of a classical algorithm that knows in advance 50% of
the information that specifies the solution of the problem. Here we check that
this 50% rule holds for the main quantum algorithms. In the structured
problems, a classical algorithm with the advanced information, to identify the
missing information should perform one function evaluation. The speed up is
exponential since a classical algorithm without advanced information should
perform an exponential number of function evaluations. In unstructured database
search, a classical algorithm that knows in advance 50% of the n bits of the
database location, to identify the n/2 missing bits should perform Order(2
power n/2) function evaluations. The speed up is quadratic since a classical
algorithm without advanced information should perform Order(2 power n) function

photodetection events (quantum jumps) and no-count processes. The class of
emerging atomic many-body states can be chosen via the optical geometry and
light frequencies. Light detection along the angle of a diffraction maximum

wish to generate a random bit in order to choose between two alternatives. This
task is impossible to realize when it relies solely on the asynchronous
exchange of classical bits: one dishonest player has complete control over the
final outcome. It is only when coin flipping is supplemented with quantum
communication that this problem can be alleviated, although partial bias
remains. Unfortunately, practical systems are subject to loss of quantum data,
which restores complete or nearly complete bias in previous protocols. We
report herein on the first implementation of a quantum coin-flipping protocol
that is impervious to loss. Moreover, in the presence of unavoidable
experimental noise, we propose to use this protocol sequentially to implement
many coin flips, which guarantees that a cheater unwillingly reveals
asymptotically, through an increased error rate, how many outcomes have been
fixed. Hence, we demonstrate for the first time the possibility of flipping
coins in a realistic setting. Flipping quantum coins thereby joins quantum key
distribution as one of the few currently practical applications of quantum
communication. We anticipate our findings to be useful for various
cryptographic protocols and other applications, such as an online casino, in
which a possibly unlimited number of coin flips has to be performed and where
each player is free to decide at any time whether to continue playing or not.

one is decoherence, which means that the interference between every pair of

consistency, or linear positivity, but these are ruled out by the requirement
of consistent composition of subsystems, proposed by Diosi. Here we propose a
new condition which we call partial decoherence, and is the requirement that
every history has zero interference with its negation. This is weaker than
decoherence and stronger than linear positivity (but its relation to
consistency is less simply defined -- it is neither stronger nor weaker). Most
importantly, it satisfies the Diosi condition. A strengthened Diosi condition

essential that the effect of exchange upon probability of inner electron
ionization by strong electric field is proportional to the square of the number

described by inequalities equivalent to a complete set of uncertainty relations
for the quantum domain and to nonnegativity of probability density on phase
space in the classical domain. Intersection of such sets is studied. The
mathematical mechanism which allows to construct different kinds of tomographic
probabilities like symplectic tomograms, spin tomograms, photon number
tomograms, etc., is clarified and a connection with abstract Hilbert space
properties is established. Superposition rule and uncertainty relations in
terms of probabilities as well as quantum basic equation like quantum evolution

still of great interest today. He found that three particles subjected to a
resonant pairwise interaction can join into an infinite number of loosely bound
states even though each particle pair cannot bind. Interestingly, the
properties of these aggregates, such as the peculiar geometric scaling of their
energy spectrum, are universal, i.e. independent of the microscopic details of
their components. Despite an extensive search in many different physical
systems, including atoms, molecules and nuclei, the characteristic spectrum of
Efimov trimer states still eludes observation. Here we report on the discovery
of two bound trimer states of potassium atoms very close to the Efimov
scenario, which we reveal by studying three-particle collisions in an ultracold
gas. Our observation provides the first evidence of an Efimov spectrum and
allows a direct test of its scaling behaviour, shedding new light onto the
physics of few-body systems.

  Entanglement","Joy Christian","  An elementary topological error in Bell's representation of the EPR elements
of reality is identified. Once recognized, it leads to a topologically correct
local-realistic framework that provides exact, deterministic, and local
underpinning of at least the Bell, GHZ-3, GHZ-4, and Hardy states. The
correlations exhibited by these states are shown to be exactly the classical
correlations among the points of a 3 or 7-sphere, both of which are closed
under multiplication, and hence preserve the locality condition of Bell. The
alleged non-localities of these states are thus shown to result from
misidentified topologies of the EPR elements of reality. When topologies are
correctly identified, local-realistic completion of any arbitrary entangled
state is always guaranteed in our framework. This vindicates EPR, and entails
that quantum entanglement is best understood as an illusion.

are different at the Wilson-Fisher and Gaussian fixed points, and the epsilon

entropy S_n = (log tr rho^n_A)/(1-n) in epsilon and large-N expansions. For N

by raising the temperature, one type of string-net structure is thermalized and
the associative topological entropy vanishes. In the thermodynamic limit the
underlying topological order is fragile even at very low temperatures. Taking
first the thermodynamic limit and then the zero-temperature limit and vice

systems in compact, robust, and scalable setups. An important tool in this
system is a potential depending on the internal atomic state. Coherent dynamics
in this potential combined with collisional interactions allows entanglement
generation both for individual atoms and ensembles. Here, we demonstrate
coherent manipulation of Bose-condensed atoms in such a potential, generated in
a novel way with microwave near-fields on an atom chip. We reversibly entangle
atomic internal and motional states, realizing a trapped-atom interferometer
with internal-state labelling. Our system provides control over collisions in
mesoscopic condensates, paving the way for on-chip generation of many-particle
entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology with spin-squeezed states.

$\sim$ $k_B T$; weak bonds stabilizing intermediate states (enabling $direct$
conversion of chemical into mechanical energy). For their (unknown) origins, we
suggest that a magnetically structured phase (MSP) formed via accretion of
super-paramagnetic particles (S-PPs) by magnetic rocks on the Hadean Ocean
floor had hosted motor-like diffusion of ligand-bound S-PPs through its
template-layers; its ramifications range from optical activity to quantum
coherence. A gentle flux gradient offers both detailed-balance breaking
non-equilibrium and $asymmetry$ to a magnetic dipole, undergoing infinitesimal
spin-alignment changes. Periodic perturbation of this background by local
H-fields of template-partners can lead to periodic high and low-template
affinity states, due to the dipole's magnetic degree of freedom. An
accompanying magnetocaloric effect allows interchange between system-entropy
and bath temperature. We speculate on a magnetic reproducer in a setting close
to the mound-scenario of Russell and coworkers that could evolve bio- ratchets.

both in physical science and today's philosophy of nature are evaluated. To
this end, Lewis' thesis of Humean supervenience is presented as an important
case study of an atomistic doctrine in philosophical thought. According to the
thesis of Humean supervenience, the world is fragmented into local matters of
particular fact and everything else supervenes upon them in conjunction with
the spatiotemporal relations among them. It is explicitly shown that Lewis'
ontological doctrine of Humean supervenience incorporates at its foundation the
so-called separability principle of classical physics. In view of the
systematic violation of the latter within quantum mechanics, it is argued that
contemporary physical science posits non-supervenient relations over and above
the spatiotemporal ones. It is demonstrated that the relation of quantum
entanglement constitutes the prototypical example of a holistic, irreducible
physical relation that does not supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of
Humean qualities, undermining, thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It
is concluded, in this respect, that the assumption of ontological reductionism,
as expressed in Lewis' Humean doctrine, cannot be regarded as a reliable code
of the nature of the physical world and its contents. It is proposed instead
that - due to the undeniable existence of generic non-supervenient relations -
a metaphysic of relations of a moderate kind ought to be acknowledged as an
indispensable part of our understanding of the natural world at a fundamental
level.

demonstrate that our set-up allows continuous quantum key distribution even in

philosophical point of view. It is justified the opinion that the philosophical
attitude the Copenhagen interpretation is based on is in principle inevitable
for a real comprehension of quantum theory. This attitude is mainly related to
epistemological arguments. However, the measurement problem often seems not to
be treated clearly enough within the interpretation. By referring to the
property of the necessity to use macroscopic measurement instruments obeying
classical concepts it is made the attempt to solve the measurement problem.
According to this consideration the indeterministic character of quantum theory
seems to have its origin in a lack of knowledge and thus it appears in a
similar but more principle way than in statistical mechanics. It is emphasized
the ontological character of the uncertainty relation and the related non
locality of quantum theory suggesting that the existence of a position space is
not as fundamental as the assumptions of general quantum theory.

nonclassical state (pure squeezed state, for instance), entanglement may be
created between members of the chain. In the setup considered here, we found
that a great family of nonclassical (squeezed) states can localize entanglement
in such a way that distant oscillators never become entangled. We present a
detailed study of this particular localization phenomenon. Our results may find
application in future solid state implementations of quantum computers, and we

excellent axial resolution can be obtained in a photon-counting coherence

  generalized Peres-Horodecki conditions","Paul B. Slater","  The probability that a generic real, complex or quaternionic two-qubit state
is separable can be considered to be the sum of three contributions. One is
from those states that are absolutely separable, that is those (which can not
be entangled by unitary transformations) for which the maximal concurrence over
spectral orbits (C_{max}) is zero. The other two contributions are from the
states for which C_{max} in [0,1/2], and for which C_{max} in [1/2,1]. We have
previously (arXiv:0805.0267) found exact formulas for the absolutely separable
contributions in terms of the Hilbert-Schmidt metric over the quantum states,
and here advance hypotheses as to the exact contributions for C_{max} in
[1/2,1]. A crucial element in understanding the other two contributions is the
nature of the ratio (R) of the C_{max}-parameterized separability function for
the complex states to the square of the comparable function for the real
states--both such functions having clearly displayed jump discontinuities at
C_{max}=1/2. For C_{max} in [0,1/2], R appears to be of the form 1+ k C_{max},
except near C_{max}=1/2, while for C_{max} in [1/2,1], it seems to be a
constant (thus according to the Dyson-index pattern of random matrix theory).
Related phenomena also occur for the minimally-degenerate two-qubit states and
the qubit-qutrit states. Our results have immediate application to the
computation of separability probabilities in terms of other metrics, such as
the Bures (minimal monotone) metric. The paper begins with continuous
embeddings of the separability probability question in terms of four metrics of
interest, using ""generalized Peres-Horodecki conditions"".

Lagrangian approach we obtain a transformation that makes the extended PU
oscillator, with unequal frequencies, to be equivalent to two standard second
order oscillators which have the original number of degrees of freedom. Such
extension is provided by adding a total time derivative to the PU Lagrangian
together with a complexification of the original variables further subjected to
reality conditions in order to maintain the required number of degrees of
freedom. The analysis is accomplished at both the classical and quantum levels.
Remarkably, at the quantum level the negative norm states are eliminated, as
well as the problems of unbounded below energy and non-unitary time evolution.
We illustrate the idea of our approach by eliminating the negative norm states
in a complex oscillator. Next, we extend the procedure to the Pais-Uhlenbeck
oscillator. The corresponding quantum propagators are calculated using
Schwinger's quantum action principle. We also discuss the equal frequency case

  evolution, probability, and scientific confirmation","Adrian Kent","  There is a compelling intellectual case for exploring whether purely unitary
quantum theory defines a sensible and scientifically adequate theory, as
Everett originally proposed. Many different and incompatible attempts to define
a coherent Everettian quantum theory have been made over the past fifty years.
However, no known version of the theory (unadorned by extra ad hoc postulates)
can account for the appearance of probabilities and explain why the theory it
was meant to replace, Copenhagen quantum theory, appears to be confirmed, or
more generally why our evolutionary history appears to be Born-rule typical.
This article reviews some ingenious and interesting recent attempts in this
direction by Wallace, Greaves, Myrvold and others, and explains why they don't
work. An account of one-world randomness, which appears scientifically
satisfactory, and has no many-worlds analogue, is proposed. A fundamental
obstacle to confirming many-worlds theories is illustrated by considering some
toy many-worlds models. These models show that branch weights can exist without
having any role in either rational decision-making or theory confirmation, and
also that the latter two roles are logically separate. Wallace's proposed
decision theoretic axioms for rational agents in a multiverse and claimed
derivation of the Born rule are examined. It is argued that Wallace's strategy
of axiomatizing a mathematically precise decision theory within a fuzzy
Everettian quasiclassical ontology is incoherent. Moreover, Wallace's axioms
are not constitutive of rationality either in Everettian quantum theory or in
theories in which branchings and branch weights are precisely defined. In both
cases, there exist coherent rational strategies that violate some of the
axioms.

provided that the single photon detections are mutually independent, and
further, it has the advantage in generation efficiency of random bits since no
postprocessing is needed. A true random number generator based on this new

"5215","Synthesis of linear quantum stochastic systems via quantum feedback
  networks","H. I. Nurdin","  Recent theoretical and experimental investigations of coherent feedback
control, the feedback control of a quantum system with another quantum system,
has raised the important problem of how to synthesize a class of quantum
systems, called the class of linear quantum stochastic systems, from basic
quantum optical components and devices in a systematic way. The synthesis
theory sought in this case can be naturally viewed as a quantum analogue of
linear electrical network synthesis theory and as such has potential for
applications beyond the realization of coherent feedback controllers. In
earlier work, Nurdin, James and Doherty have established that an arbitrary
linear quantum stochastic system can be realized as a cascade connection of
simpler one degree of freedom quantum harmonic oscillators, together with a
direct interaction Hamiltonian which is bilinear in the canonical operators of
the oscillators. However, from an experimental perspective and based on current
methods and technologies, direct interaction Hamiltonians are challenging to
implement for systems with more than just a few degrees of freedom. In order to
facilitate more tractable physical realizations of these systems, this paper
develops a new synthesis algorithm for linear quantum stochastic systems that
relies solely on field-mediated interactions, including in implementation of
the direct interaction Hamiltonian. Explicit synthesis examples are provided to
illustrate the realization of two degrees of freedom linear quantum stochastic
systems using the new algorithm.

derived for both situations and both regimes of weak and strong coupling

computing separately the effects of diffusion and the attenuation of the

  systems with Kraus-map evolution","Anand Oza|Alexander Pechen|Jason Dominy Vincent Beltrani|Katharine Moore|Herschel Rabitz","  A quantum control landscape is defined as the expectation value of a target
observable $\Theta$ as a function of the control variables. In this work
control landscapes for open quantum systems governed by Kraus map evolution are
analyzed. Kraus maps are used as the controls transforming an initial density
matrix $\rho_{\rm i}$ into a final density matrix to maximize the expectation
value of the observable $\Theta$. The absence of suboptimal local maxima for
the relevant control landscapes is numerically illustrated. The dependence of
the optimization search effort is analyzed in terms of the dimension of the
system $N$, the initial state $\rho_{\rm i}$, and the target observable
$\Theta$. It is found that if the number of nonzero eigenvalues in $\rho_{\rm
i}$ remains constant, the search effort does not exhibit any significant
dependence on $N$. If $\rho_{\rm i}$ has no zero eigenvalues, then the
computational complexity and the required search effort rise with $N$. The
dimension of the top manifold (i.e., the set of Kraus operators that maximizes
the objective) is found to positively correlate with the optimization search
efficiency. Under the assumption of full controllability, incoherent control
modelled by Kraus maps is found to be more efficient in reaching the same value
of the objective than coherent control modelled by unitary maps. Numerical
simulations are also performed for control landscapes with linear constraints
on the available Kraus maps, and suboptimal maxima are not revealed for these
landscapes.

criterion, fixing the coupling strengths between all the oscillators, apart

easily manipulated formula enabling perfect state transfer in the special case
where the network nonidealities are disregarded. By adjusting the common

to the receiver oscillator by virtually exciting the nonideal transmitter
chain. This virtual process makes negligible the decay rate associated with the

transfer process. Apart from our analytical results, numerical computations are

$|\Psi> = |\psi>_{12} \otimes |\psi>_{34}$ and let the uncorrelated subsystems
14 and 23 interact by a given unitary $U_{14}\otimes U_{23}$: we show that the

"1514","Pulse shape effects on photon-photon interactions in non-linear optical
  quantum gates","Holger F. Hofmann|Hitoshi Nishitani","  Ideally, strong non-linearities could be used to implement quantum gates for
photonic qubits by well controlled two photon interactions. However, the
dependence of the non-linear interaction on frequency and time makes it
difficult to preserve a coherent pulse shape that could justify a single mode
model for the time-frequency degree of freedom of the photons. In this paper,
we analyze the problem of temporal multi-mode effects by considering the pulse
shape of the average output field obtained from a coherent input pulse. It is
shown that a significant part of the two photon state transformation can be
derived from this semi-classical description of the optical non-linearity. The
effect of a non-linear system on a two photon state can then be determined from
the density matrix dynamics of the coherently driven system using input-output
theory. As an example, the resonant non-linearity of a single two level atom is
characterized. The results indicate that the most efficient non-linear effect
may not be the widely studied single mode phase shift, but the transfer of one
of the photons to an orthogonal mode distinguished by its temporal and spectral
properties.

construct an autonomous dynamics for the classical particle in successive
orders of the small ratio $\epsilon$ of the characteristic times. It is known
that in the order $\epsilon^0$ the particle gets an additional
[Born-Oppenheimer] potential, while in the order $\eps^1$ it feels an effective
magnetic field related to the Berry phase. In the order $\epsilon^2$ the motion
of the classical particle can be reduced to a free [geodesic] motion on a
curved Riemannian manifold, with the metric generated by the excluded quantum
system. This motion has a number of unusual features, e.g., it combines
subspaces of different (Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian) signature for the
metric tensor. In the order $\epsilon^3$ the motion of the classical particle
is still described by a Lagrangian, but the latter linearly depends on the
particle's acceleration. This implies the existence of a spin tensor
[non-orbital angular momentum] for the particle. This spin tensor is related to
the momentum via an analogue of the zitterbewegung effect. The Hamiltonian
structure of the system is non-trivial and is defined via non-linear Poisson
brackets. The linear dependence of the effective classical Lagrangian on
higher-order derivatives is seen as well in the higher orders $\epsilon^n$.

quantization effects tend to reduce the force with respect to the continuum

for film size of the order of few nanometers and persists for separation
distances up to 10 nm. Comparison with previous work indicates that the
softening of the boundary potential is important in determining the amount of
the reduction. The calculations are extended to treat Drude intraband

based on the lattice of closed linear subspaces of some Hilbert space, or, more
generally, on the lattice of projections in a von Neumann algebra A.
Unfortunately, the logical interpretation of these lattices is impaired by
their nondistributivity and by various other problems. We show that a possible
resolution of these difficulties, suggested by the ideas of Bohr, emerges if
instead of single projections one considers elementary propositions to be
families of projections indexed by a partially ordered set C(A) of appropriate
commutative subalgebras of A. In fact, to achieve both maximal generality and
ease of use within topos theory, we assume that A is a so-called Rickart
C*-algebra and that C(A) consists of all unital commutative Rickart
C*-subalgebras of A. Such families of projections form a Heyting algebra in a
natural way, so that the associated propositional logic is intuitionistic:
distributivity is recovered at the expense of the law of the excluded middle.
  Subsequently, generalizing an earlier computation for n-by-n matrices, we
prove that the Heyting algebra thus associated to A arises as a basis for the
internal Gelfand spectrum (in the sense of Banaschewski-Mulvey) of the
""Bohrification"" of A, which is a commutative Rickart C*-algebra in the topos of
functors from C(A) to the category of sets. We explain the relationship of this

"4414","Information Causality as a Physical Principle","M. Pawlowski|T. Paterek|D. Kaszlikowski|V. Scarani|A. Winter|M. Zukowski","  Quantum physics exhibits remarkable distinguishing characteristics. For
example, it gives only probabilistic predictions (non-determinism) and does not
allow copying of unknown state (no-cloning). Quantum correlations may be
stronger than any classical ones, nevertheless information cannot be
transmitted faster than light (no-signaling). However, all these features do
not single out quantum physics. A broad class of theories exist which share
such traits with quantum mechanics, while they allow even stronger than quantum
correlations. Here, we introduce the principle of Information Causality. It
states that information that Bob can gain about a previously completely unknown
to him data set of Alice, by using all his local resources (which may be
correlated with her resources) and a classical communication from her, is
bounded by the information volume of the communication. In other words, if
Alice communicates m bits to Bob, the total information access that Bob gains
to her data is not greater than m. For m=0, Information Causality reduces to
the standard no-signaling principle. We show that this new principle is
respected both in classical and quantum physics, whereas it is violated by all
the no-signaling correlations which are stronger that the strongest quantum
correlations. Maximally strong no-signalling correlations would allow Bob
access to any m bit subset of the whole data set held by Alice. If only one bit
is sent by Alice (m=1), this is tantamount to Bob being able to access the
value of any single bit of Alice's data (but of course not all of them). We
suggest that Information Causality, a generalization of no-signaling, might be
one of the foundational properties of Nature.

the absence of Klein's paradox and the localization of bosons in the presence

that the interference contrast in a three-grating atom interferometer does not
vanish under the presence of scattering events with photons, as required by the
complementarity principle. In this work we provide an analytical study of this
experiment, determining the evolution of the atom wave function along the
three-grating Mach-Zehnder interferometer under the assumption that the atom is
hit by a photon after passing through the first grating. The consideration of a
transverse wave function in momentum representation is essential in this study.
As is shown, the number of atoms transmitted through the third grating is given
by a simple periodic function of the lateral shift along this grating, both in
the absence and in the presence of photon scattering. Moreover, the relative
contrast (laser on/laser off) is shown to be a simple analytical function of
the ratio d_p/\lambda_i, where d_p is the distance between atomic paths at the
scattering locus and \lambda_i the scattered photon wavelength. We argue that
this dependence, being in agreement with experimental results, can be regarded
to show compatibility of the wave and corpuscle properties of atoms.

N x N 2-dimensional grid and a quantum problem involving finding the ground
state energy of a 1-dimensional quantum system of N particles. In both cases,
the only input is N, provided in binary. We show that the classical problem is
NEXP-complete and the quantum problem is QMA_EXP-complete. Thus, an algorithm
for these problems which runs in time polynomial in N (exponential in the input
size) would imply that EXP = NEXP or BQEXP = QMA_EXP, respectively. Although
tiling in general is already known to be NEXP-complete, to our knowledge, all
previous reductions require that either the set of tiles and their constraints
or some varying boundary conditions be given as part of the input. In the
problem considered here, these are fixed, constant-sized parameters of the
problem. Instead, the problem instance is encoded solely in the size of the

Special attention is given to the category which has finite dimensional Hilbert
spaces as objects, linear maps as morphisms, and the tensor product as its
monoidal structure (FdHilb). We also provide a detailed discussion of the
category which has sets as objects, relations as morphisms, and the cartesian
product as its monoidal structure (Rel), and thirdly, categories with manifolds
as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms (2Cob). While sets,
Hilbert spaces and manifolds do not share any non-trivial common structure,
these three categories are in fact structurally very similar. Shared features
are diagrammatic calculus, compact closed structure and particular kinds of
internal comonoids which play an important role in each of them. The categories
FdHilb and Rel moreover admit a categorical matrix calculus. Together these
features guide us towards topological quantum field theories. We also discuss
posetal categories, how group representations are in fact categorical
constructs, and what strictification and coherence of monoidal categories is
all about. In our attempt to complement the existing literature we omitted some
very basic topics. For these we refer the reader to other available sources.

Quantum Computation (ADQC) combines aspects of the quantum circuit and the
one-way model to overcome challenging issues in building large-scale quantum
computers. Instead of directly manipulating each qubit to perform universal
quantum logic gates or measurements, ADQC uses a fixed two-qubit interaction to
couple the memory register of a quantum computer to an ancilla qubit. By
measuring the ancilla, the measurement-induced back-action on the system
performs the desired logical operations.
  By demanding that the ancilla-system qubit interaction should lead to unitary
and stepwise deterministic evolution, and that it should be possible to
standardise the computation, that is, applying all global operations at the
beginning, we are able to place conditions on the interactions that can be used
for ADQC. We prove there are only two such classes of interactions
characterised in terms of the non-local part of the interaction operator. This
leads to the definition of a new entanglement resource called twisted graph
states generated from non-commuting operators. The ADQC model is formalised in
an algebraic framework similar to the Measurement Calculus. Furthermore, we
present the notion of causal flow for twisted graph states, based on the

continuous version of the LMC complexity, which is recovered for $\alpha=1$ and
$\beta=2$. These complexity measures are obtained by multiplying two quantities
bringing global information on the probability distribution defining the
system. When one of the parameters, $\alpha$ or $\beta$, goes to infinity, one
of the global factors becomes a local factor. For this special case, the
complexity is calculated on different quantum systems: H-atom, harmonic
oscillator and square well.

"790","In the Kreisgang between classical and quantum physics","Caslav Brukner","  All our statements about the physical world are expressed in terms of
everyday notions and thus in terms of classical physics. This necessity is
behind each of our attempt to extract meaning out of empirical data and to
communicate this knowledge to others. As such, it must apply also to the
account of measurement arrangements and to the outcome in quantum experiments.
On the other hand, however, if quantum mechanics is universally valid it should
be possible to give a purely quantum mechanical description of objects of
increasingly large sizes, eventually of the measurement devices themselves. It
is suggested to resolve this dilemma by using the method of von Weizsaecker's
circular and consistent movement in a reconstruction (Kreisgang) in which it is
legitimate to recover the elements with which one started the reconstruction.
The parameters entering the complex amplitudes of a quantum state have an
operational meaning as parameters that specify the configuration of macroscopic
instruments by which the state is prepared and measured. This classical aspect
in each quantum description is at the ""beginning"" of the Kreisgang. The
Kreisgang is ""closed"" by showing that under the every-day conditions of
coarse-grained measurements a description of macroscopic instruments emerges in
terminology of classical physics and the three-dimensional ordinary space from
within quantum theory.

dephasing, depolarizing, and generalized amplitude damping, assuming
independent perturbation, in which each qubit is coupled to its own channel.
Choosing initial conditions that manifest the so-called sudden death of
entanglement, we compare the dynamics of entanglement with that of quantum
discord. We show that in all cases where entanglement suddenly disappears,
quantum discord vanishes only in the asymptotic limit, behaving similarly to
individual decoherence of the qubits, even at finite temperatures. Hence,
quantum discord is more robust than the entanglement against to decoherence so
that quantum algorithms based only on quantum discord correlations may be more
robust than those based on entanglement.

many degrees of freedom. This representation is based on a perturbative
expansion in quantum fluctuations around one of the classical limits. We
explicitly analyze expansions around three such limits: (i) corpuscular or
Newtonian limit in the coordinate-momentum representation, (ii) wave or
Gross-Pitaevskii limit for interacting bosons in the coherent state
representation, and (iii) Bloch limit for the spin systems. We discuss both the
semiclassical (truncated Wigner) approximation and further quantum corrections
appearing in the form of either stochastic quantum jumps along the classical
trajectories or the nonlinear response to such jumps. We also discuss how
quantum jumps naturally emerge in the analysis of non-equal time correlation
functions. This representation of quantum dynamics is closely related to the
phase space methods based on the Wigner-Weyl quantization and to the Keldysh
technique. We show how such concepts as the Wigner function, Weyl symbol, Moyal
product, Bopp operators, and others automatically emerge from the Feynmann's
path integral representation of the evolution in the Heisenberg representation.
We illustrate the applicability of this expansion with various examples mostly
in the context of cold atom systems including sine-Gordon model, one- and
two-dimensional Bose Hubbard model, Dicke model and others.

designing logic gate operations with systems like ion traps, semicondutor
quantum dots and atoms. We show that the interactions lead to a phenomenon of
periodic disentanglement and entanglement between the qubits. The
disentanglement is primarily caused by environmental perturbations. The qubits
are seen to remain disentangled for a finite time before getting entangled
again. We find that the phenomenon is generic and occurs for wide variety of
models of the environment. We present analytical results for the time
dependence of concurrence for all the models. The periodic disentanglement and
entanglement behavior is seen to be precursor to the sudden death of
entanglement (ESD) and can happen, for environments which do not show ESD for
noninteracting qubits. Further we also find that this phenomenon can even lead

  is tight","Lev B. Levitin|Tommaso Toffoli","  The question of how fast a quantum state can evolve has attracted a
considerable attention in connection with quantum measurement, metrology, and
information processing. Since only orthogonal states can be unambiguously
distinguished, a transition from a state to an orthogonal one can be taken as
the elementary step of a computational process. Therefore, such a transition
can be interpreted as the operation of ""flipping a qubit"", and the number of
orthogonal states visited by the system per unit time can be viewed as the
maximum rate of operation.
  A lower bound on the orthogonalization time, based on the energy spread
DeltaE, was found by Mandelstam and Tamm. Another bound, based on the average
energy E, was established by Margolus and Levitin. The bounds coincide, and can
be exactly attained by certain initial states if DeltaE=E; however, the problem
remained open of what the situation is otherwise.
  Here we consider the unified bound that takes into account both DeltaE and E.
We prove that there exist no initial states that saturate the bound if DeltaE
is not equal to E. However, the bound remains tight: for any given values of
DeltaE and E, there exists a one-parameter family of initial states that can
approach the bound arbitrarily close when the parameter approaches its limit
value. The relation between the largest energy level, the average energy, and
the orthogonalization time is also discussed. These results establish the
fundamental quantum limit on the rate of operation of any
information-processing system.

optimize the number of holes, the number of doubly-occupied sites. Entanglement
is calculated explicitly for Gutzwiller-projected many-electron states in one

these states. Entanglement in superconducting states, which tend to promote
double occupancy, is calculated as a function of the energy gap, and found to

  Interaction","C. C. Leary|M. G. Raymer|S. J. van Enk","  We show that when an electron or photon propagates in a cylindrically
symmetric waveguide, its spin angular momentum (SAM) and its orbital angular
momentum (OAM) interact. Remarkably, we find that the dynamics resulting from
this spin-orbit interaction are quantitatively described by a single expression
applying to both electrons and photons. This leads to the prediction of several
novel rotational effects: the spatial or time evolution of either particle's
spin/polarization vector is controlled by the sign of its OAM quantum number,
or conversely, its spatial wavefunction is controlled by its SAM. We show that
the common origin of these effects in electrons and photons is a universal
geometric phase. We demonstrate how these phenomena can be used to reversibly
transfer entanglement between the SAM and OAM degrees of freedom of
two-particle states.

many-body quantum systems, in which electronic coherence has recently been
shown to survive for relatively long time scales despite the decohering effects

multi-chromophoric light harvesting complexes, and establish methods for
quantification of entanglement by presenting necessary and sufficient
conditions for entanglement and by deriving a measure of global entanglement.
These methods are then applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein to
extract the initial state and temperature dependencies of entanglement. We show
that while FMO in natural conditions largely contains bipartite entanglement
between dimerized chromophores, a small amount of long-range and multipartite
entanglement exists even at physiological temperatures. This constitutes the
first rigorous quantification of entanglement in a biological system. Finally,
we discuss the practical utilization of entanglement in densely packed
molecular aggregates such as light harvesting complexes.

simplifying the classification of protocols and strategies using the

The analytical solution of the equations of theory of gravity, in which matter

quantum corrections ~ h dominate over the radiation, the geometry of the

This leads to the notion of undecidability: there is no way to tell, due to
fundamental limitations, if a quantum system evolved unitarily or suffered
wavefunction collapse. This in turn provides a solution to the problem of
outcomes in quantum measurement by providing a sharp criterion for defining
when an event has taken place. We analyze in detail in examples two situations
in which in principle one could recover information about quantum coherence: a)
""revivals"" of coherence in the interaction of a system with the environment and
b) the measurement of global observables of the system plus apparatus plus
environment. We show in the examples that the fundamental limitations due to

unconditional security is also presented. This scheme has significant
advantages in real-life implementations as it does not require fast optical
switching or a quantum random number generator. The essential idea is to use a
beam splitter to split each input pulse. We show that we can characterize the
source using a cross-estimate technique without active routing of each pulse.
We have derived analytical expressions for the passive estimation scheme.
Moreover, using simulations, we have considered four real-life imperfections:
Additional loss introduced by the ""plug & play"" structure, inefficiency of the
intensity monitor, noise of the intensity monitor, and statistical fluctuation
introduced by finite data size. Our simulation results show that the passive
estimate of an untrusted source remains useful in practice, despite these four
imperfections. Also, we have performed preliminary experiments, confirming the
utility of our proposal in real-life applications. Our proposal makes it
possible to implement the ""plug & play"" QKD with the security guaranteed, while
keeping the implementation practical.

injecting broad band squeezed vacuum light and laser light into the cavity. We
work in the resolved sideband regime. We find that in order to obtain the
maximum momentum squeezing of the movable mirror, the squeezing parameter of
the input light should be about 1. We can obtain more than 70% squeezing.
Besides, for a fixed squeezing parameter, decreasing the temperature of the
environment or increasing the laser power increases the momentum squeezing. We
find very large squeezing with respect to thermal fluctuations, for instance at
1 mK, the momentum fluctuations go down by a factor more than one hundred.

  coupling to surface polaritons","Joseph Kerckhoff|Hideo Mabuchi","  Contemporary experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) with
gas-phase neutral atoms rely increasingly on laser cooling and optical,
magneto-optical or magnetostatic trapping methods to provide atomic
localization with sub-micron uncertainty. Difficult to achieve in free space,
this goal is further frustrated by atom-surface interactions if the desired
atomic placement approaches within several hundred nanometers of a solid
surface, as can be the case in setups incorporating monolithic dielectric
optical resonators such as microspheres, microtoroids, microdisks or photonic
crystal defect cavities. Typically in such scenarios, the smallest atom-surface
separation at which the van der Waals interaction can be neglected is taken to
be the optimal localization point for associated trapping schemes, but this
sort of conservative strategy generally compromises the achievable cavity QED
coupling strength. Here we suggest a new approach to the design of optical
dipole traps for atom confinement near surfaces that exploits strong surface
interactions, rather than avoiding them, and present the results of a numerical
study based on $^{39}$K atoms and indium tin oxide (ITO). Our theoretical
framework points to the possibility of utilizing nanopatterning methods to
engineer novel modifications of atom-surface interactions.

differ crucially in the case of observables with degenerate spectra. Such
observables play the fundamental role in operations with entangled states: any
measurement on one subsystem is represented by an observable with degenerate
spectrum in the Hilbert space of a composite system. If von Neumann was right

way quantum computing'' would not work. Surprisingly, we found that, in fact,
von Neumann's description of measurements via refinement implies (under natural

observation was missed during last 70 years. This result closed the problem of
the proper use of the projection postulate in quantum information theory. One
can proceed with L\""uders postulate (as people in quantum information really

affected by the back-action from the transport qubit and losses in the cavity.
In addition, we show that the non-integrable quantum chaotic character of the
Dicke model is retained in an open-system environment. We propose how all of
these effects could been seen in a circuit QED system formed from an array of
superconducting qubits, or an atom chip, coupled to a quantized resonant cavity

"10015","Fault tolerant architectures for superconducting qubits","David P. DiVincenzo","  In this short review, I draw attention to new developments in the theory of
fault tolerance in quantum computation that may give concrete direction to
future work in the development of superconducting qubit systems. The basics of
quantum error correction codes, which I will briefly review, have not
significantly changed since their introduction fifteen years ago. But an
interesting picture has emerged of an efficient use of these codes that may put
fault tolerant operation within reach. It is now understood that two
dimensional surface codes, close relatives of the original toric code of
Kitaev, can be adapted to effectively perform logical gate operations in a very
simple planar architecture, with error thresholds for fault tolerant operation
simulated to be 0.75%. This architecture uses topological ideas in its
functioning, but it is not 'topological quantum computation' -- there are no
non-abelian anyons in sight. I offer some speculations on the crucial pieces of
superconducting hardware that could be demonstrated in the next couple of years
that would be clear stepping stones towards this surface-code architecture.

  and variational boundary conditions","A. Edery|N. Graham|I. MacDonald","  Under dimensional reduction, a system in D spacetime dimensions will not
necessarily yield its D-1-dimensional analog version. Among other things, this
result will depend on the boundary conditions and the dimension D of the
system. We investigate this question for scalar and abelian gauge fields under
boundary conditions that obey the symmetries of the action. We apply our
findings to the Casimir piston, an ideal system for detecting boundary effects.
Our investigation is not limited to extra dimensions and we show that the
original piston scenario proposed in 2004, a toy model involving a scalar field
in 3D (2+1)dimensions, can be obtained via dimensional reduction from a more
realistic 4D electromagnetic (EM) system. We show that for perfect conductor
conditions, a D-dimensional EM field reduces to a D-1 scalar field and not its
lower-dimensional version. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, no theory is
recovered under dimensional reduction and the Casimir pressure goes to zero in
any dimension. This ""zero Dirichlet"" result is useful for understanding the EM
case. We then identify two special systems where the lower-dimensional version
is recovered in any dimension: systems with perfect magnetic conductor (PMC)
and Neumann boundary conditions. We show that these two boundary conditions can
be obtained from a variational procedure in which the action vanishes outside
the bounded region. The fields are free to vary on the surface and have zero
modes which survive after dimensional reduction.

inducing an effective coupling between the two parts of the system depending on
the choice made for the spectral density of the bath. The coupling is nonlinear
in the system variables and an exponential dependence on these variables is
imposed in order to guarantee the translational invariance of the model if the
two particles are not subject to any external potential. The reduced density
operator is obtained by the functional integral method. The dynamical
susceptibility of the reservoir is modelled in order to introduce, besides a
characteristic frequency, a characteristic length that determines if the
effective interaction potential is strong enough to induce entanglement between
the particles. Our model provides a criterion of distance for identifying in
which cases a common environment can induce entanglement. Three regimes are

coupling, the long distance regime in which the particles act like coupled to
independent reservoirs and the intermediate regime suitable for the competition

characterized by the same deformed Heisenberg algebra, but with different
deformation parameters, we define the total momentum and the center-of-mass
position to first order in the deformation parameters. Such operators satisfy
the deformed algebra with new effective deformation parameters. As a
consequence, a two-particle system can be reduced to a one-particle problem for
the internal motion. As an example, the correction to the hydrogen atom $n$S
energy levels is re-evaluated. Comparison with high-precision experimental data
leads to an upper bound of the minimal length for the electron equal to
$3.3\times 10^{-18} {\rm m}$. The effective Hamiltonian describing the
center-of-mass motion of a macroscopic body in an external potential is also
found. For such a motion, the effective deformation parameter is substantially
reduced due to a factor $1/N^2$. This explains the strangely small result
previously obtained for the minimal length from a comparison with the observed
precession of the perihelion of Mercury. From our study, an upper bound of the
minimal length for quarks equal to $2.4\times 10^{-17}{\rm m}$ is deduced,
which appears close to that obtained for electrons.

  Experiments of Quantum Measurement","Hai-Long Zhao","  In the derivation of Bell's inequalities, probability distribution is
supposed to be a function of only hidden variable. We point out that the true
implication of the probability distribution of Bell's correlation function is
the distribution of the joint measurement outcomes on the two sides. So it is a
function of both hidden variable and settings. In this case, Bell's
inequalities fail. Our further analysis shows that Bell's locality holds
neither for dependent events nor for independent events. We think that the
measurements of EPR pairs are dependent events, thus violation of Bell's
inequalities cannot rule out the existence of local hidden variable. In order
to explain the results of EPR-type experiments, we suppose that polarization
entangled photon pair can be composed of two circularly or linearly polarized
photons with correlated hidden variables, and a couple of experiments of
quantum measurement are proposed. The first uses delayed measurement on one
photon of the EPR pair to demonstrate directly whether measurement on the other
could have any non-local influence on it. Then several experiments are
suggested to reveal the components of polarization entangled photon pair. The
last one uses successive polarization measurements on a pair of EPR photons to
show that two photons with a same quantum state will behave in the same way
under the same measuring condition.

"3716","Quantum Measure Theory: A New Interpretation","Yousef Ghazi-Tabatabai","  Quantum measure theory can be introduced as a histories based reformulation
(and generalisation) of Copenhagen quantum mechanics in the image of classical
stochastic theories. These classical models lend themselves to a simple
interpretation in which a single history (a single element of the sample space)
is deemed to be 'real'; we require only that this real history should not be
ruled out by the dynamics, the axioms of which ensure that not all histories
are precluded. However, applying this interpretation naively to quantum measure
theory we can find experimentally realisable systems (notably the
Peres-Kochen-Specker system) in which every history is ruled out by the
dynamics, challenging us to formulate a deeper realist framework.
  Our first response is to hold on to our existing interpretative framework and
attempt a revision of the dynamics that would reduce quantum measure theory to
a classical dynamics. We explore this approach by examining the histories
formulation of a stochastic-collapse model on a simple (discrete) null-lattice,
concluding that the drawbacks of this approach outweigh the benefits.
  Our second response is to abandon our classically inspired interpretation in
favour of Sorkin's 'co-events', a more general ontology that still allows for
strict realism. In this case the 'potentially real' objects of the theory (the
'beables' in Bell's language) are not individual histories but truth valuation
maps, or co-events. We develop & evaluate various co-event schemes that have
been suggested to date, finally adopting the multiplicative scheme; the current
working model of co-event theory and a promising interpretation of quantum
measure theory, though still a work in progress. We conclude by exploring the
expression of the dynamics & predictions in this new framework.

cases in which the strong superadditivity is also violated. The sates
numerically found where the violation occurs have special symmetries where both

[Phys. Rev. A 73, 034307 (2006)] have shown that under the original
deterministic dense-coding protocol, in which messages are encoded by unitary
operations performed on Alice's qudit, it is impossible to encode d^2-1
messages. Encoding d^2-2 is possible; see, e.g., the numerical studies by Mozes

allow encoding by more general quantum operators. We then describe a

demonstrate full control of the qubit Bloch vector, performing arbitrary
high-fidelity rotations ($\tau_{\pi}\sim$200 $\mu$s). Randomized Benchmarking
demonstrates an error per gate (a Pauli-randomized $\pi/2$ and $\pi$ pulse

"6016","A Soliton Model of the Electron with an internal Nonlinearity cancelling
  the de Broglie-Bohm Quantum Potential","Roald Ekholdt","  The paper proposes an envelope soliton model of the electron that propagates
as a protuberance on a fictitious waveguide, which acts as trajectory. The
model is based on de Broglie's original electron wave-particle relativistic
theory, and on the observation that the Klein-Gordon equation governs the
propagation mode of a common microwave waveguide - with the Schroedinger
equation as a low group velocity approximation. This analogy opened for
practical physical models, including solitons. In the linear case a conceived
corpuscle zigzags within the fictitious waveguide - a zigzagging that resembles
Penrose's picture of Dirac's electron theory. The soliton envelope is defined
by a special nonlinear version of the Schroedinger equation. The nonlinearity
cancels the de Broglie/Bohm Quantum Potential of the envelope. The wavefunction
is confined by the envelope, and thus the concept of the collapse of the
wavefunction is eliminated. Since the electron model is based directly on the
Special theory of relativity it also illustrates that theory. The corpuscle,
incorporating spin and charge, which moves at the speed of light, needs further
study relating it to the photon. A model of the photon based on the mutual
coupling of two modes of an optical fiber at the Planck scale, is suggested.
One of these modes is thought to carry two orthogonal polarized electromagnetic
external fields, while the other, internal, mode carries a corpuscle that moves
helically and thus represents the spin. A single electron is considered to have
one polarization only, without any superposition possibility; hence, the
concept of collapse in a polarization measurement is eliminated.

measuring correlations of two entangled particles (e.g. polarization of photons

have to be satisfied. First, strict separation of the measurement events in the

all entangled pairs have to be detected (for particles in a maximally entangled
state the required detector efficiency is 82.8%), which is hard to achieve

possible to entangle two atoms at a large distance via entanglement swapping.

determining the limitations of cooling to absolute zero. We find that if the

there is a minimum achievable temperature above zero. Such a gap, combined with
a negligible amount of noise, prevents adiabatic following during the
demagnetization stage which is the necessary condition for reaching $T_c \to
0$. The refrigerator is based on an Otto cycle where the working medium is an
interacting spin system with an energy gap. For this system the external
control Hamiltonian does not commute with the internal interaction. As a result
during the demagnetization and magnetization segments of the operating cycle
the system cannot follow adiabatically the temporal change in the energy
levels. We connect the nonadiabatic dynamics to quantum friction. An adiabatic
measure is defined characterizing the rate of change of the Hamiltonian. Closed
form solutions are found for a constant adiabatic measure for all the cycle
segments. We have identified a family of quantized frictionless cycles with
increasing cycle times. These cycles minimize the entropy production. Such
frictionless cycles are able to cool to $T_c=0$. External noise on the controls
eliminates these frictionless cycles. The influence of phase and amplitude
noise on the demagnetization and magnetization segments is explicitly derived.
An extensive numerical study of optimal cooling cycles was carried out which
showed that at sufficiently low temperature the noise always dominates

therefore ambiguous. For a specific PT-symmetric 2x2-matrix Hamilton operator

lattice, using an attractive mixture of mass-imbalanced bosons. Starting from a

out-of-equilibrium state. When neighboring molecular wavefunctions overlap,
both bosonic species simultaneously exhibit quasi-condensation and long-range
solid order, which is stabilized by their mass imbalance. Supersolidity appears
in a perfect one-dimensional crystal, without the requirement of doping. Our
model can be realized in present experiments with bosonic mixtures that feature
simple on-site interactions, clearing the path to the observation of
supersolidity.

"9218","Does quantum mechanics tell an atomistic spacetime?","Hans-Thomas Elze","  The canonical answer to the question posed is ""Yes."" -- tacitly assuming that
quantum theory and the concept of spacetime are to be unified by `quantizing' a
theory of gravitation. Yet, instead, one may ponder: Could quantum mechanics
arise as a coarse-grained reflection of the atomistic nature of spacetime? --
We speculate that this may indeed be the case. We recall the similarity between
evolution of classical and quantum mechanical ensembles, according to Liouville
and von Neumann equation, respectively. The classical and quantum mechanical
equations are indistinguishable for objects which are free or subject to
spatially constant but possibly time dependent, or harmonic forces, if
represented appropriately. This result suggests a way to incorporate anharmonic
interactions, including fluctuations which are tentatively related to the
underlying discreteness of spacetime. Being linear and local at the quantum
mechanical level, the model offers a decoherence and natural localization
mechanism. However, the relation to primordial deterministic degrees of freedom
is nonlocal.

  MQ NMR dynamics is determined by the residual dipole-dipole interactions

  Since the averaged non-secular Hamiltonian describing MQ NMR dynamics depends
on only one coupling constant, this Hamiltonian commutes with the square of the
total spin angular momentum $\hat I^2$.
  We use the basis of common eigenstates of $\hat I^2$ and the projection of
$I$ on the external magnetic field for investigation of MQ NMR dynamics.
  This approach allows us to study MQ NMR dynamics in systems consisting of
several hundreds of spins. The analytical approximation of the stationary
profile of MQ coherences is obtained.
  The analytical expressions for MQ NMR coherence intensities of the five-spin
system in a nanopore are found.
  Numerical investigations allow us to find the dependencies of intensities of

can readily be achieved by optimizing the local inductance of the resonator in
the vicinity of the qubit. In addition to yielding stronger coupling with
respect to other proposals for flux qubit based circuit QED, this approach
leads to a qubit-resonator coupling strength g which does not scale as the area
of the qubit but is proportional to the total inductance shared between the
resonator and the qubit. Strong coupling can thus be attained while still
minimizing sensitivity to flux noise. Finally, we show that by taking advantage
of the the large kinetic inductance of a Josephson junction in the center
conductor of the resonator can lead to coupling energies of several tens of
percent of the resonator frequency, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime of

defined as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix obtained by
tracing over one of the two parts. Critical ground states of local Hamiltonians
in one dimension have an entanglement entropy that diverges logarithmically in
the subsystem size, with a universal coefficient that is is related to the
central charge of the associated conformal field theory. Here I will discuss
recent extensions of these ideas to a class of quantum critical points with
dynamic critical exponent $z=2$ in two space dimensions and to 2D systems in a
topological phase. The application of these ideas to quantum dimer models and

"3317","Approximating the Permanent via Nonabelian Determinants","Cristopher Moore|Alexander Russell","  Celebrated work of Jerrum, Sinclair, and Vigoda has established that the
permanent of a {0,1} matrix can be approximated in randomized polynomial time
by using a rapidly mixing Markov chain. A separate strand of the literature has
pursued the possibility of an alternate, purely algebraic, polynomial-time
approximation scheme. These schemes work by replacing each 1 with a random
element of an algebra A, and considering the determinant of the resulting
matrix. When A is noncommutative, this determinant can be defined in several
ways. We show that for estimators based on the conventional determinant, the
critical ratio of the second moment to the square of the first--and therefore
the number of trials we need to obtain a good estimate of the permanent--is (1
+ O(1/d))^n when A is the algebra of d by d matrices. These results can be
extended to group algebras, and semi-simple algebras in general. We also study
the symmetrized determinant of Barvinok, showing that the resulting estimator
has small variance when d is large enough. However, for constant d--the only
case in which an efficient algorithm is known--we show that the critical ratio
exceeds 2^{n} / n^{O(d)}. Thus our results do not provide a new polynomial-time
approximation scheme for the permanent. Indeed, they suggest that the algebraic
approach to approximating the permanent faces significant obstacles.
  We obtain these results using diagrammatic techniques in which we express
matrix products as contractions of tensor products. When these matrices are
random, in either the Haar measure or the Gaussian measure, we can evaluate the
trace of these products in terms of the cycle structure of a suitably random
permutation. In the symmetrized case, our estimates are then derived by a
connection with the character theory of the symmetric group.

exact reason of this has not been pinpointed until now. Our explanation is that
quantum algorithms know in advance 50% of the solution of the problem they will
find in the future. In fact they can be represented as the sum of all the
possible histories of a respective ""advanced information classical algorithm"".
This algorithm, given the advanced information (50% of the bits encoding the
problem solution), performs the operations (oracle's queries) still required to
identify the solution. Each history corresponds to a possible way of getting
the advanced information and a possible result of computing the missing
information. This explanation of the quantum speed up has an immediate
practical consequence: the speed up comes from comparing two classical
algorithms, with and without advanced information, with no physics involved.
This simplification could open the way to a systematic exploration of the
possibilities of speed up.

that it is possible to design the pulse in order to achieve a decoupling of the
spin from the bath up to the third order in $\tau_\mathrm{p}$. The evolution of
the system is separated in the evolution of the spin under the action of the
pulse and of the bath times correction terms. We derive the correction terms
for a general time dependent axis of rotation and for a general coupling
between the spin and the environment. The resulting corrections can be made
vanish by an appropriate design of the pulse. For $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ pulses, we
demonstrate explicitly that pulses exist which annihilate the first and the
second order corrections even if the bath is fully quantum mechanical, i.e., it
displays internal dynamics. Such pulses will also be useful for quantum

We find that the steady-state entanglement can be coherently controlled through
the tuning of the phase difference between the driving fields. It can also be
surprisingly high in spite of the pumps being classical fields. For some
implementations where the connecting element can be a fiber, long-distance
steady state quantum correlations can be established. Furthermore, the maximal
of entanglement for any pair is achieved when their corresponding direct
coupling is much smaller than their individual couplings to the third party.
This effect is reminiscent of the establishment of coherence between otherwise

measure this entanglement by analyzing the correlations of the emitted photons

takes into account how one should assign probabilities to the consequences of
various intended measurements on a physical system, but explicitly in terms of
prior probabilities for and conditional probabilities consequent upon the

evaluated numerically, in a three-dimensional rectangular resonant cavity
bisected by a semiconductor diaphragm (SD), which is irradiated by a pulsed
laser with frequency of GHz order. The aim of this paper is to determine some
of the optimum conditions required to detect DCE photons relevant to a novel
experimental detection system. We expand upon the thin plasma sheet model
[Crocce et al., Phys. Rev. A 70 033811 (2004)] to estimate the number of
photons for both TE and TM modes at any given SD position. Numerical
calculations are performed considering up to 51 inter-mode couplings by varying
the SD location, driving period and laser power without any perturbations. It
is found that the number of photons created for TE modes strongly depends on SD
position, where the strongest enhancement occurs at the midpoint (not near the
cavity wall); while TM modes have weak dependence on SD position. Another
important finding is the fact that significant photon production for TM$_{111}$
modes still takes place at the midpoint even for a low laser power of 0.01
micro J/pulse, although the number of TE$_{111}$ photons decreases almost
proportionately with laser power. We also find a relatively wide tuning range
for both TE and TM modes that is correlated with the frequency variation of the
instantaneous mode functions caused by the interaction between the cavity
photons and conduction electrons in the SD excited by a pulsed laser.

situation looks like a ``space-time foam'' with the defects ``flashing'' on and
off (``D-particle foam''). The open strings, with their ends attached on the

strategies are developed in this thesis which construct the operations by
random selection from a suitable set. Furthermore, it is investigated if and
how the discussed decoupling strategies can be employed to protect a quantum
computation running on the quantum memory.
  The second part of the thesis deals with quantum error-correcting codes and
protocols for quantum key distribution. The focus is on the BB84 and the
6-state protocol making use of only one-way communication during the error
correction and privacy amplification steps. It is shown that by adding
additional errors to the preliminary key (a process called noisy preprocessing)
followed by the use of a structured block code, higher secure key rates may be
obtained. For the BB84 protocol it is shown that iterating the combined
preprocessing leads to an even higher gain.

brane. In order to properly compute the contribution to the Casimir energy due
to any higher dimensional field, it is necessary to take into account the
localization properties of the KK modes. When no massless mode appears in the
spectrum, the correction to the Casimir energy is exponentially suppressed.
When a massless mode is present in the spectrum, the correction to the Casimir
energy can be, in principle, sizeable. Here we illustrate a new method to
compute the correction to the Casimir energy between two parallel plates,
localized on a brane. The Casimir energy is suppressed by two factors: at
lowest order in $\varepsilon$, the correction comes entirely from the massive
mode and turns out to be exponentially suppressed; the next-to-leading order
correction in $\varepsilon$ follows, instead, a power-law suppression due to
the small wave function overlap of the zero-mode with matter confined on the
visible brane. Generic comments on the constraints on new physics that may
arise from Casimir force experiments are also made.

the problem of wavefunction uncollapse: Given an unknown state that has been
disturbed by a generalized measurement, restore the state to its initial
configuration. We describe how this is probabilistically possible with a
subsequent measurement that involves erasing the information extracted about
the state in the first measurement. The general theory of abstract measurements
is discussed, focusing on quantum information aspects of the problem, in
addition to investigating a variety of specific physical situations and
explicit measurement strategies. Several systems are considered in detail: the
quantum double dot charge qubit measured by a quantum point contact (with and
without Hamiltonian dynamics), the superconducting phase qubit monitored by a
SQUID detector, and an arbitrary number of entangled charge qubits.
Furthermore, uncollapse strategies for the quantum dot electron spin qubit, and
the optical polarization qubit are also reviewed. For each of these systems the
physics of the continuous measurement process, the strategy required to ideally
uncollapse the wavefunction, as well as the statistical features associated
with the measurement is discussed. We also summarize the recent experimental
realization of two of these systems, the phase qubit and the polarization
qubit.

frequently such that there is no probability for him to reach the top of the
barrier, he will be always inside the well, then a classical Zeno effect
occurs. On the other hand, if the time interval between two subsequent checks
is large enough such that he has a higher probability of being beyond the
demon's controllable range already, then the demon's check actually speeds up
his escape and a classical anti-Zeno effect takes place.

control the population of two internal levels of an atom/molecule. We
investigate the conditions to adiabatically split or transport a BEC as well as
to prepare an adiabatic self trapping state by the optimal delayed temporal

wells or the BEC non-linearity. The emergence of non-linear eigenstates and
unstable stationary solutions of the system as well as their role in the
breaking down of the adiabatic dynamics is investigated in detail.

approximation of the full quantum mechanical description of intracellular

Cf is the effect of the molecular target of catalysis on the catalytic
microenvironment that adjusts the microenvironment towards a state that
facilitates the catalytic act. This phenomenon is experimentally testable and
has an intriguing implication for biological organization and evolution, as it
amounts to ""optimization without natural selection of replicators"". Unlike the
statistical-mechanical approaches to self-organization, the Cf principle does
not encounter the problem of ""tradeoff between stability and complexity"" at the
level of individual cell. Physically, the Cf is considered as a harmonic-like
force of reaction, which keeps the state of the cell close to the ground state,
defined here as a state where enzymatic acts work most efficiently. Ground
state is subject to unitary evolution, and serves as a starting point in a
general strategy of quantum description of intracellular processes, termed here
""Euclidean approach"". The next step of this strategy is transition from the
description of ground state to that one of growing state, and we suggest how it
can be accomplished using arguments from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
Finally, given that the most reliable and informative observable of an
individual cell is the sequence of its genome, we propose that the
non-classical correlations between individual molecular events at the single

emergence of the evolution time from the group of automorphisms of the von
Neumann algebra governed by this non-linear correction. It turns out that such
time parametrization is essentially energy-dependent and becomes global only
asymptotically - when the energies get very small comparing to the effective
quantum gravity scale. Similar thing happens to the Lorentz invariance - in the
resulting theory it becomes an asymptotic low-energy phenomenon. We show how
the logarithmic non-linearity deforms the vacuum wave dispersion relations and
explains certain features of the astrophysical data coming from recent
observations of high-energy cosmic rays. In general, the estimates imply that
ceteris paribus the particles with higher energy propagate slower than those
with lower one, therefore, for a high-energy particle the mean free path,
lifetime in a high-energy state and, therefore, travel distance from the source
can be significantly larger than one would expect from the conventional theory.

which properties of macroscopic systems exist independent of and are not
influenced by measurement. Motivated by classical physical laws such as
Newtonian mechanics or Maxwell's electrodynamics, in this work we add the
restrictive postulate that the observables of macroscopic objects are evolved
continuously through space and time. Quantum theory violates both macroscopic
realism and the continuity assumption. While decoherence or collapse models

restore macroscopic realism, we show that a continuous spatiotemporal
description does not become possible in general. This shines new light on the

"1319","What is a quantum computer, and how do we build one?","Carlos A. Perez-Delgado|Pieter Kok","  The DiVincenzo criteria for implementing a quantum computer have been seminal
in focussing both experimental and theoretical research in quantum information
processing. These criteria were formulated specifically for the circuit model
of quantum computing. However, several new models for quantum computing
(paradigms) have been proposed that do not seem to fit the criteria well. The
question is therefore what are the general criteria for implementing quantum
computers. To this end, a formal operational definition of a quantum computer
is introduced. It is then shown that according to this definition a device is a
quantum computer if it obeys the following four criteria: Any quantum computer
must (1) have a quantum memory; (2) facilitate a controlled quantum evolution
of the quantum memory; (3) include a method for cooling the quantum memory; and
(4) provide a readout mechanism for subsets of the quantum memory. The criteria
are met when the device is scalable and operates fault-tolerantly. We discuss
various existing quantum computing paradigms, and how they fit within this
framework. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for selecting an avenue towards
building a quantum computer. This is summarized in a decision tree intended to
help experimentalists determine the most natural paradigm given a particular
physical implementation.

optimization problem over the quantum control landscape, defined as a metric
for realizing a desired unitary transformation as a function of the control

specific constraints in the Hamiltonian corresponding to certain dynamical

independent of what (quantum) systems the legitimate parties' devices operate
on: they do not have to be trusted. Unfortunately, the protocol proposed by

system describes an isolated subsystem of a classical statistical ensemble with
infinitely many classical states. The state of this subsystem can be
characterized by only a few probabilistic observables. Their expectation values
define a density matrix if they obey a ""purity constraint"". Then all the usual
laws of quantum mechanics follow, including Heisenberg's uncertainty relation,
entanglement and a violation of Bell's inequalities. No concepts beyond
classical statistics are needed for quantum physics - the differences are only
apparent and result from the particularities of those classical statistical
systems which admit a quantum mechanical description. Born's rule for quantum
mechanical probabilities follows from the probability concept for a classical
statistical ensemble. In particular, we show how the non-commuting properties
of quantum operators are associated to the use of conditional probabilities
within the classical system, and how a unitary time evolution reflects the
isolation of the subsystem. As an illustration, we discuss a classical
statistical implementation of a quantum computer.

several issues concerning bounds on concurrence measurable collectively on

concurrence by Mintert--Buchleitner [F. Mintert and A. Buchleitner, Phys. Rev.

entanglement, we provide a method allowing for construction of lower bounds on
concurrence from any positive map (not only the reduction one). All these
quantities can be measured as mean values of some two--copy observables. In
this sense the method generalizes the Mintert--Buchleitner bound and recovers
it when the reduction map is used. As a particular case we investigate the
bound obtained from the transposition map. Interestingly, comparison with MB
bound performed on the class of 4\otimes 4 rotationally invariant states shows
that the new bound is positive in regions in which the MB bound gives zero.

arbitrary geometries and for arbitrary materials that was based on a
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme. In this manuscript, we focus on
the efficient implementation of our method for geometries of practical interest
and extend our previous proof-of-concept algorithm in one dimension to problems
in two and three dimensions, introducing a number of new optimizations. We
consider Casimir piston-like problems with nonmonotonic and monotonic force
dependence on sidewall separation, both for previously solved geometries to
validate our method and also for new geometries involving magnetic sidewalls
and/or cylindrical pistons. We include realistic dielectric materials to
calculate the force between suspended silicon waveguides or on a suspended
membrane with periodic grooves, also demonstrating the application of PML
absorbing boundaries and/or periodic boundaries. In addition we apply this
method to a realizable three-dimensional system in which a silica sphere is
stably suspended in a fluid above an indented metallic substrate. More
generally, the method allows off-the-shelf FDTD software, already supporting a
wide variety of materials (including dielectric, magnetic, and even anisotropic
materials) and boundary conditions, to be exploited for the Casimir problem.

computer several groups have started to develop miniaturized ion traps for
extended spatial control and manipulation of the ions. Shuttling and separation
of ion strings have been the foremost issues in linear-trap arrangements and
some prototypes of junctions have been demonstrated for the extension of ion
motion to two dimensions (2D). While junctions require complex trap structures,
small extensions to the 1D motion can be accomplished in simple linear trap
arrangements. Here, control of the extended field in a planar, linear chip trap
is used to shuttle ions in 2D. With this approach, the order of ions in a
string is deterministically reversed. Optimized potentials are theoretically
derived and simulations show that the reordering can be carried out
adiabatically. The control over individual ion positions in a linear trap
presents a new tool for ion-trap quantum computing. The method is also expected
to work with mixed crystals of different ion species and as such could have
applications for sympathetic cooling of an ion string.

signals the breakdown of the spacetime continuum picture near that scale, and
on the other hand, it can predict an upper bound on the quantum gravity

providing families of EAQECCs with an entanglement consumption rate that

possible variance in ways that are readily implementable with current
experimental techniques. Measurements whose statistics have high-frequency
fringes, such as those obtained from NOON states, have commensurately high
information yield. However this information is also highly ambiguous because it
does not distinguish between phases at the same point on different fringes. We
provide schemes to eliminate this phase ambiguity in a highly efficient way,
providing phase estimates with uncertainty that is within a small constant
factor of the Heisenberg limit, the minimum allowed by the laws of quantum
mechanics. These techniques apply to NOON state and multi-pass interferometry,
as well as phase measurements in quantum computing. We have reported the
experimental implementation of some of these schemes with multi-pass
interferometry elsewhere. Here we present the theoretical foundation, and also
present some new experimental results. There are three key innovations to the
theory in this paper. First, we examine the intrinsic phase properties of the
sequence of states (in multiple time modes) via the equivalent two-mode state.
Second, we identify the key feature of the equivalent state that enables the
optimal scaling of the intrinsic phase uncertainty to be obtained. This enables
us to identify appropriate combinations of states to use. The remaining
difficulty is that the ideal phase measurements to achieve this intrinic phase
uncertainty are often not physically realizable. The third innovation is to
solve this problem by using realizable measurements that closely approximate
the optimal measurements, enabling the optimal scaling to be preserved.

lack in the latter of a full mechanical determinism: different final states can
arise from the same physical state, after the measurement. No hidden variable

a more fundamental theory that (approximately) coincides with quantum mechanics

describes measurement processes giving an explicit time evolution of the wave
function during the collapse. The theory is deterministic even if the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle is still valid. The theory distinguishes
physical states that collapse and physical states that do not collapse. The
theory can be made compatible with all experiments done in the past, but new
phenomena such as violations of the Born law or the superposition principle

classical computer. The time required for solving the Schr\""odinger equation to
obtain molecular energies has been demonstrated to scale polynomially with
system size on a quantum computer, in contrast to the well-known result of
exponential scaling on a classical computer. In this paper, we present a
quantum algorithm to obtain the energy spectrum of molecular systems based on
the multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) wave function. By using
a MCSCF wave function as the initial guess, the excited states are accessible;
Entire potential energy surfaces of molecules can be studied more efficiently
than if the simpler Hartree-Fock guess was employed. We show that a small
increase of the MCSCF space can dramatically increase the success probability
of the quantum algorithm, even in regions of the potential energy surface that
are far from the equilibrium geometry. For the treatment of larger systems, a
multi-reference configuration interaction approach is suggested. We demonstrate
that such an algorithm can be used to obtain the energy spectrum of the water
molecule.

When such a channel E exists, we can globally compare A and B in terms of their

any ensemble of states, fed into each channel and possibly entangled with
ancillae, emerges no more distinguishable from A than it does from channel B,

behavior of all systems described approximately by local quantum field theory.
The deviations from classical behavior of a macroscopic body, except for those
that can be described as classical uncertainties in the initial values of
macroscopic variables,are {\it exponentially} small as a function of the volume
of the macro-system in microscopic units. Conventional estimates are correct
only when the internal degrees of freedom of the macrosystem are in their
ground state, and the classical motion of collective coordinates is adiabatic.
Otherwise, the system acts as its own environment and washes out quantum phase
correlations between different classical states of its collective coordinates.
I suggest that it is likely that we can only achieve meso-scopic
superpositions, for systems which have topological variables, and for which we
can couple to those variables without exciting phonons.

"7320","Geometrical aspects of qudits concerning Bell inequalities","Christoph Spengler","  The aim of this thesis is to investigate quantum entanglement and quantum
nonlocality of bipartite finite-dimensional systems (bipartite qudits).
Entanglement is one of the most fascinating non-classical features of quantum
theory, and besides its impact on our view of the world, it can be exploited
for applications such as quantum cryptography and quantum computing. (...)
Although entanglement and nonlocality are ordinarily regarded as one and the
same, under close consideration this cannot be taken for granted. The reason
for this is that entanglement is defined by the mathematical structure of a
quantum state in a composite Hilbert space, whereas nonlocality signifies that
the statistical behaviour of a system cannot be described by a local realistic
theory. For the latter it is essential that the correlation probabilities of
such theories obey so-called Bell inequalities, which are violated for certain
quantum states. The main focus of this thesis is on the comparison of both
properties with the objective of understanding their relation. (...) Because of
the fact that the correlation probabilities in general depend on the
measurement settings it is necessary to optimise these in order to reveal
nonlocality. This problem is solved for a particular Bell inequality (CGMLP) by
means of a self-developed numerical search algorithm. The method is then
applied to density matrices of a subspace spanned by the projectors of
maximally entangled two-qudit states. This set of states (...) serves to
visualise and analyse the state space geometrically.

which is perpendicular to a set of vectors, each of which lies in the Hilbert
space of k qubits. Equivalently, the problem is to decide whether a particular
type of local Hamiltonian has a ground state with zero energy. We consider
random quantum k-SAT formulas with n variables and m = \alpha n clauses, and
ask at what value of \alpha these formulas cease to be satisfiable. We show
that the threshold for random quantum 3-SAT is at most 3.594. For comparison,
convincing arguments from statistical physics suggest that the classical 3-SAT
threshold is \alpha \approx 4.267. For larger k, we show that the quantum
threshold is a constant factor smaller than the classical one. Our bounds work
by determining the generic rank of the satisfying subspace for certain gadgets,
and then using the technique of differential equations to analyze various
algorithms that partition the hypergraph into a collection of these gadgets.
Our use of differential equation to establish upper bounds on a satisfiability
threshold appears to be novel, and our techniques may apply to various
classical problems as well.

The spin bath is described by the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the bath spins
are subjected to a transverse magnetic field. We investigate the qubit
interacting via either an Ising- or an XY-type coupling term to subsets of bath
spins of differing size. The large degree of symmetry of the bath allows us to
find parameter regimes where the initial qubit state is revived at well defined
times after the qubit preparation. These times may become independent of the
bath size for large baths and thus enable faithful qubit storage even in the
presence of strong coupling to a bath. We analyze a large range of parameters
and identify those which are best suited for quantum memories. In general we
find that a small number of links between qubit and bath spins leads to less
decoherence and that systems with Ising coupling between qubit and bath spins

holes with contracting horizons is proposed. The method is based on a gedanken
experiment on quantum energy teleportation (QET), which has been recently
proposed in quantum information theory. We consider this QET protocol for N
massless fields in near-horizon regions of large-mass black holes with
near-horizon geometry described by the Minkowski metric. For each field, a
two-level spin is strongly coupled with the local quantum fluctuation outside
the horizon during a short time period. After the measurement of N fields,
N-bit information is obtained. During the measurement, positive-energy wave
packets of the fields form and then fall into the black hole. The amount of
excitation energy is independent of the measurement result. After absorption of
the wave packets and increase of the black hole mass, a
measurement-result-dependent local operation of the N fields is performed
outside the horizon. Then, accompanying the extraction of positive energy from
the quantum fluctuation by the operation, negative-energy wave packets of the
fields form and then fall into the black hole, decreasing the black hole mass.
This implies that a part of the absorbed positive energy emitted from the
measurement devices is effectively retrieved from the black hole via the
measurement results.

x-component parameters can increase the entanglement and the critical
temperature more efficiently. Furthermore, we show the properties of these
x-component parameters for the control of entanglement. In the ground state,
increasing $D_{x}$ (spin-orbit coupling parameter) can decrease the critical
value $b_{xc}$ and increase the entanglement in the revival region, and
adjusting some parameters (increasing $b_{x}$ and $J$, decreasing $B_{x}$ and
$\Delta$) can decrease the critical value $D_{xc}$ to enlarge the revival
region. In the thermal state, increasing $D_{x}$ can increase the revival
region and the entanglement in the revival region (for $T$ or $b_{x}$), and
enhance the critical value $B_{xc}$ to make the region of high entanglement
larger. Also, the entanglement and the revival region will increase with the
decrease of $B_{x}$ (uniform magnetic field). In addition, small $b_{x}$
(nonuniform magnetic field) has some similar properties to $D_{x}$, and with
the increase of $b_{x}$ the entanglement also has a revival phenomenon, so that
the entanglement can exist at higher temperature for larger $b_{x}$.

Oscillator type operators obey several useful properties in case if the

"8105","Entangled states : Classical versus Quantum","S. Kanmani","  Quantum mechanics of composite systems, gives rise to certain special states
called entangled states. A physical system, that is in an entangled state
displays an intricate correlation between its subsystems. There are also some
composite quantum states (classically correlated states or separable states)
that are not entangled. It is generally claimed, often without a rigorous proof
to support, that these intricate correlations of an entangled state cannot
occur in a classical system. This expository article, provides an elementary
proof that entangled states cannot arise in the setting of classical mechanics.
In addition, a detailed description of the origin of entanglement in quantum
systems is included. The mathematical concepts that are necessary for this
purpose are presented. The absence of entanglement in the classical setting is
due to the fact that every pure classical state of a composite system is a
product state, that is, a tensor product of two pure states of the subsystems.
In contrast, there are pure composite quantum states that cannot be expressed
in the form of a product state or even by a convex sum of product states.
Roughly speaking, this is because classical states are positive valued
functions on the phase-space while quantum states are positive linear
operators. The structure of the tensor product between two commutative spaces
of scalar valued functions is drastically different from that of the tensor
product between two non-commutative spaces of linear operators. In other words,
entanglement is a non-commutative phenomenon.

utilization of this effect for getting faster signals is the exponential

faster signals: the probability for a signal to reach its destination before
some deadline is always reduced by the tunnel, for arbitrary incoming states,
arbitrary positive and compactly supported tunnel potentials, and arbitrary
detectors. More specifically, we show this for several different ways to define
``the same incoming state'' and ''the same detector'' when comparing the

entangling qubits. By allowing for influences from environments, taking

quantum theory of irreversibility and thermodynamics for a single isolated or
adiabatic particle, qubit, or qudit, and recently rediscovered by other
authors. The nonlinear equation generates a dynamical group, not just a
semigroup, providing a deterministic description of irreversible conservative
relaxation towards equilibrium from any non-equilibrium density operator. It
satisfies a very restrictive stability requirement equivalent to the
Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the second law of thermodynamics. We then
examine the form of the evolution equation we proposed to describe multipartite
isolated or adiabatic systems. This hinges on novel nonlinear projections
defining local operators that we interpret as ``local perceptions'' of the
overall system's energy and entropy. Each component particle contributes an
independent local tendency along the direction of steepest increase of the
locally perceived entropy at constant locally perceived energy. It conserves
both the locally-perceived energies and the overall energy, and meets strong
separability and non-signaling conditions, even though the local evolutions are
not independent of existing correlations. We finally show how the geometrical
construction can readily lead to other thermodynamically relevant models, such

flowing or average action. They interpolate continuously from the microphysics
at atomic or molecular distance scales to the macroscopic physics at much
larger length scales, as given by the interparticle distance, the correlation
length, or the size of the experimental probe. We discuss the phase diagram as
a function of the scattering length and the temperature and compute the gap,
the correlation length and the scattering length for molecules. Close to the
critical temperature, we find the expected universal behavior. Our approach
allows for a description of the few-body physics (scattering and molecular
binding) and the many-body physics within the same formalism.

sum of the frequencies of the two photons is on resonance with the upper atomic

the photons are effectively confined in all three dimensions and the two-photon

electrons. The wave function proposed by Chandrasekhar is revisited, where the
permutation symmetry is first broken and then restored by a counter-term. More
delicate problems can be studied using the same strategy: the stability of
hydrogen-like ions $(M^+,m^-,m^-)$ for any value of the proton-to-electron mass
ratio $M/m$; the energy of the lowest spin-triplet state of helium and
helium-like ions; the stability of the doubly-excited hydrogen ion with
unnatural parity. The positronium molecule $(e^+,e^+,e^-,e^-)$, which has been
predicted years ago and discovered recently, can also be shown to be stable
against spontaneous dissociation, though the calculation is a little more
involved. Emphasis is put on symmetry breaking which can either spoil or
improve the stability of systems.

behavior of massive particles in terms of trajectories. As shown by
Bialynicki-Birula, Electromagnetism also admits a hydrodynamical formulation
when the existence of a wave function for photons (properly defined) is
assumed. This formulation thus provides an alternative interpretation of
optical phenomena in terms of photon trajectories, whose flow yields a
pictorial view of the evolution of the electromagnetic energy density in
configuration space. This trajectory-based theoretical framework is considered
here to study and analyze the outcome from Young-type diffraction experiments
within the context of the Arago-Fresnel laws. More specifically, photon
trajectories in the region behind the two slits are obtained in the case where
the slits are illuminated by a polarized monochromatic plane wave. Expressions
to determine electromagnetic energy flow lines and photon trajectories within
this scenario are provided, as well as a procedure to compute them in the
particular case of gratings totally transparent inside the slits and completely
absorbing outside them. As is shown, the electromagnetic energy flow lines
obtained allow to monitor at each point of space the behavior of the
electromagnetic energy flow and, therefore, to evaluate the effects caused on
it by the presence (right behind each slit) of polarizers with the same or
different polarization axes. This leads to a trajectory-based picture of the

In particle oscillation experiments, a particle's time of detection is not

summation over amplitudes corresponding to different detection times. However,
in contrast to the principle above, standard treatments involve summation over
probabilities rather than amplitudes; this implicitly assumes the existence of
a decohering mechanism. In this work, we construct the detection probabilities
for particle oscillations by summation over amplitudes, corresponding to
different detection times. The resulting wavelength of particle oscillations
differs from the standard expression by a factor of two. Moreover, we predict a
dependence of the oscillation wavelength on the threshold of the decay process

circuit with optimized hardware complexity. The optimized multiplier circuit is
compared with the earlier proposals. We have shown that the quantum cost of
earlier proposals can be further reduced with the help of existing local
optimization algorithms (e.g. template matching, moving rule and deletion
rule). A systematic protocol for reduction of quantum cost has been proposed.
It has also been shown that the advantage in gate count obtained in some of the
earlier proposals by introduction of new reversible gates is an artifact and if
it is allowed then every circuit block can be reduced to a single gate.
Further, it is shown that the 4x4 reversible gates proposed for designing of a
component of multiplier circuit (full adder) is neither unique nor special and
many such 4x4 gates may be proposed. As example three such new gates have been
presented here and it is shown that the proposed gates are universal. It is
also shown that the total cost of our design is minimum.

behaved alternative to the number-phase uncertainty relation, and examine its
properties. We find a formulation in which the bound on the product of
uncertainties depends on the expectation value of the particle number. Thus,
while the bound is not a constant, it is a quantity that can easily be
controlled in many systems. The uncertainty relation is approximately saturated
by number-phase intelligent states. This allows us to define amplitude
squeezing, connecting coherent states to Fock states, without a reference to a

  Model","D. D. Scherer|C. A. Müller|M. Kastner","  The fidelity metric has recently been proposed as a useful and elegant
approach to identify and characterize both quantum and classical phase
transitions. We study this metric on the manifold of thermal states for the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model. For the isotropic LMG model, we find that the
metric reduces to a Fisher-Rao metric, reflecting an underlying classical
probability distribution. Furthermore, this metric can be expressed in terms of
derivatives of the free energy, indicating a relation to Ruppeiner geometry.
This allows us to obtain exact expressions for the (suitably rescaled) metric
in the thermodynamic limit. The phase transition of the isotropic LMG model is
signalled by a degeneracy of this (improper) metric in the paramagnetic phase.
Due to the integrability of the isotropic LMG model, ground state level
crossings occur, leading to an ill-defined fidelity metric at zero temperature.

Cellular Automata (QCA). Partitioned QCA (PQCA) are the most canonical of these

into the form of a PQCA. Our construction reconciles all the non-axiomatic
definitions of QCA, showing that they can all simulate one another, and hence
that they are all equivalent to the axiomatic definition. Next, we describe a
simple n-dimensional QCA capable of simulating all others, in that the initial
configuration and the forward evolution of any n-dimensional QCA can be encoded
within the initial configuration of the intrinsically universal QCA, and that
several steps of the intrinsically universal QCA then correspond to one step of
the simulated QCA. Both results are made formal by defining generalised
n-dimensional intrinsic simulation, i.e. a notion of simulation which preserves
the topology in the sense that each cell of the simulated QCA is encoded as a
group of adjacent cells in the universal QCA. We argue that this notion brings
the computer science based concepts of simulation and universality one step
closer to theoretical physics.

configuration space and the corresponding probability distributions constitute
a statistical manifold. The dynamics follows from a principle of inference, the
method of Maximum Entropy. The concept of time is introduced as a convenient
way to keep track of change. A welcome feature is that the entropic dynamics
notion of time incorporates a natural distinction between past and future. The
statistical manifold is assumed to be a dynamical entity: its curved and
evolving geometry determines the evolution of the particles which, in their
turn, react back and determine the evolution of the geometry. Imposing that the
dynamics conserve energy leads to the Schroedinger equation and to a natural
explanation of its linearity, its unitarity, and of the role of complex
numbers. The phase of the wave function is explained as a feature of purely
statistical origin. There is a quantum analogue to the gravitational
equivalence principle.

"6922","Effects of multiple pairs on visibility measurements of entangled
  photons generated by spontaneous parametric processes","Hiroki Takesue|Kaoru Shimizu","  Entangled photon-pair sources based on spontaneous parametric processes are
widely used in photonic quantum information experiments. In this paper, we
clarify the relationship between average photon-pair number and the visibility
of two-photon interference (TPI) using those entanglement sources. We consider
sources that generate distinguishable and indistinguishable entangled photon
pairs, assuming coincidence measurements that use threshold detectors. We
present formulas for the TPI visibility of a polarization entanglement that
take account of all the high-order multi-pair emission events. Moreover, we
show that the formulas can be approximated with simple functions of the average
pair number when the photon collection efficiency is small. As a result, we
reveal that an indistinguishable entangled pair provides better visibility than
a distinguishable one.

procedure that constructs multi-mode squeezed states from the vacuum by a
unitary transformation associated with the collective dynamics of the atomic

  In this work, a recently discovered duality relation between (non-smooth)

shown that the smooth min-entropy of a system A conditioned on a system B
equals the negative of the smooth max-entropy of A conditioned on a purifying

the most general formulation of Quantum Field Theory, if we leave out only the

solely on the local observable quantities (without assuming neither the
commutation relations nor even the existence of unobservable charged field
operators); one finds that only the well known (para)statistics of Bose/Fermi

Theorem purely on the basis of First Principles.

unique, canonical algebra of local field operators obeying ordinary Bose/Fermi
commutation relations at spacelike separations. In this general guise the Spin
- Statistics Theorem applies to Theories (on the four dimensional Minkowski
space) where only massive particles with finite mass degeneracy can occur. Here

decompose the resulting superlink into an entangled superposition of classical

"2423","A Categorical Framework for Quantum Theory","Thomas Filk|Albrecht von Mueller","  Underlying any theory of physics is a layer of conceptual frames. They
connect the mathematical structures used in theoretical models with physical
phenomena, but they also constitute our fundamental assumptions about reality.
Many of the discrepancies between quantum physics and classical physics
(including Maxwell's electrodynamics and relativity) can be traced back to
these categorical foundations. We argue that classical physics corresponds to
the factual aspects of reality and requires a categorical framework which
consists of four interdependent components: boolean logic, the
linear-sequential notion of time, the principle of sufficient reason, and the
dichotomy between observer and observed. None of these can be dropped without
affecting the others. However, in quantum theory the reduction postulate also
addresses the ""status nascendi"" of facts, i.e., their coming into being.
Therefore, quantum phyics requires a different conceptual framework which will
be elaborated in this article. It is shown that many of its components are
already present in the standard formalisms of quantum physics, but in most
cases they are highlighted not so much from a conceptual perspective but more
from their mathematical structures. The categorical frame underlying quantum
physics includes a profoundly different notion of time which encompasses a
crucial role for the present.

system and internal degrees of freedom of the process device. We investigate
the simplest case of a qubit memory channel with a two-level memory system. In
particular, we explicitly characterize all interactions for which the memory
depth is finite. We show that the memory effects are either infinite, or they
disappear after at most two uses of the channel. Memory channels of finite
depth can be to some extent controlled and manipulated by so-called reset
sequences. We show that actions separated by the sequences of inputs of the
length of the memory depth are independent and constitute memoryless channels.

a complex relaxation part toward thermal equilibrium. The long time dynamics is
characterized by a single relaxation rate, which is maximal when the qubit is

demonstrated that the classical simulation of the dynamics of open 1D quantum
systems with matrix product algorithms can often be dramatically improved by
performing time evolution in the Heisenberg picture. For a closed system this
was exemplified by an exact matrix product operator solution of the
time-evolved creation operator of a quadratic fermi chain with a matrix
dimension of just two. In this work we show that this exact solution can be
significantly generalized to include the case of an open quadratic fermi chain
subjected to master equation evolution with Lindblad operators that are linear
in the fermionic operators. Remarkably even in this open system the
time-evolution of operators continues to be described by matrix product
operators with the same fixed dimension as that required by the solution of a
coherent quadratic fermi chain for all times. Through the use of matrix product
algorithms the dynamical behaviour of operators in this non-equilibrium open
quantum system can be computed with a cost that is linear in the system size.
We present some simple numerical examples which highlight how useful this might
be for the more detailed study of open system dynamics. Given that Heisenberg
picture simulations have been demonstrated to offer significant accuracy
improvements for other open systems that are not exactly solvable our work also
provides further insight into how and why this advantage arises.

  accumulation","Yuichiro Matsuzaki|Simon C Benjamin|Joseph Fitzsimons","  The creation of complex entangled states, resources that enable quantum
computation, can be achieved via simple 'probabilistic' operations which are
individually likely to fail. However, typical proposals exploiting this idea
carry a severe overhead in terms of the accumulation of errors. Here we
describe an method that can rapidly generate large entangled states with an
error accumulation that depends only logarithmically on the failure
probability. We find that the approach may be practical for success rates in
the sub-10% range, while ultimately becoming unfeasible at lower rates. The
assumptions that we make, including parallelism and high connectivity, are
appropriate for real systems including measurement-induced entanglement. This
result therefore shows the feasibility for real devices based on such an
approach.

"7523","Orthomodular-Valued Models for Quantum Set Theory","Masanao Ozawa","  In 1981, Takeuti introduced quantum set theory by constructing a model of set
theory based on quantum logic represented by the lattice of closed linear
subspaces of a Hilbert space in a manner analogous to Boolean-valued models of
set theory, and showed that appropriate counterparts of the axioms of
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC) hold in the model.
In this paper, we aim at unifying Takeuti's model with Boolean-valued models by
constructing models based on general complete orthomodular lattices, and
generalizing the transfer principle in Boolean-valued models, which asserts
that every theorem in ZFC set theory holds in the models, to a general form
holding in every orthomodular-valued model. One of the central problems in this
program is the well-known arbitrariness in choosing a binary operation for
implication. To clarify what properties are required to obtain the generalized
transfer principle, we introduce a class of binary operations extending the
implication on Boolean logic, called generalized implications, including even
non-polynomially definable operations. We study the properties of those
operations in detail and show that all of them admit the generalized transfer
principle. Moreover, we determine all the polynomially definable operations for
which the generalized transfer principle holds. This result allows us to
abandon the Sasaki arrow originally assumed for Takeuti's model and leads to a
much more flexible approach to quantum set theory.

that apparatus; 3. the fact that the macroscopic part of the measurement
apparatus, having the role of amplifying the effect of that interaction to a

$T_L=T_R$. For nonsymmetric qubit-qubit couplings, however, the situation is
totally different. The baths at different temperatures would benefit the
entanglement and the entanglements between the nearest neighbors are no longer

a host of quantum-information-science concepts and effects, like quantum

approach is defined by a set of disruptive events, consisting in the action of

a system-preparation (measurement) at an arbitrary time, the subsequent
evolution of the density matrix evolution is modified. The non-stationary

preparation is performed at arbitrary long times. In spite of this property, we
demonstrate that operator expectation values and operators correlations have
the same dynamical structure, establishing the validity of a non-stationary

also analyzed through the response of the system to an external weak

"1724","The speed of Markovian relaxation towards the ground state","Malte Vogl|Gernot Schaller|Tobias Brandes","  For sufficiently low reservoir temperatures, it is known that open quantum
systems subject to decoherent interactions with the reservoir relax towards
their ground state in the weak coupling limit. Within the framework of quantum
master equations, this is formalized by the Born-Markov-secular (BMS)
approximation, where one obtains the system Gibbs state with the reservoir
temperature as a stationary state. When the solution to some problem is encoded
in the (isolated) ground state of a system Hamiltonian, decoherence can
therefore be exploited for computation. The computational complexity is then
given by the scaling of the relaxation time with the system size $n$.
  We study the relaxation behavior for local and non-local Hamiltonians that
are coupled dissipatively with local and non-local operators to a bosonic bath
in thermal equilibrium. We find that relaxation is generally more efficient
when coherences of the density matrix in the system energy eigenbasis are taken
into account. In addition, the relaxation speed strongly depends on the matrix
elements of the coupling operators between initial state and ground state.
  We show that Dicke superradiance is a special case of our relaxation models
and can thus be understood as a coherence-assisted relaxation speedup.

paradoxically increases the detection rate at some points on the detection
screen. Feynman famously warned that temptation to ""understand"" such a puzzling
feature only draws us into blind alleys. Nevertheless, we gain insight into
this feature by drawing an analogy between the double slit experiment and a
time reversed fire alarm. Much as closing the slit increases probability of a
future detection, ruling out fire drill scenarios, having heard the fire alarm,
increases probability of a past fire (using Bayesian inference). Classically,
Bayesian inference is associated with computing probabilities of past events.
We therefore identify this feature of the double slit experiment with a time
reversed thermodynamic arrow. We believe that much of the enigma of quantum
mechanics is simply due to some variation of time's arrow. In further support
of this, we employ a plausible formulation of the thermodynamic arrow to derive
an uncertainty in classical mechanics that is reminiscent of quantum
uncertainty.

systems over an extended period of time and then reporting the accumulated

this task. Decoherence considerations show that this task can be considered as
involving local observations under classical conditions (LOCC), allowing the
use of classical automata theory to define a minimal observer. It is shown that
such a minimal observer must implement a functional architecture equivalent to
a classical Turing machine and must encode in |O^r> a classical specification
of the complete set of reportable apparatus states. The observation task is
then re-characterized employing an explicit model of such a minimal observer,
and it is shown that both the assumption that external systems have
well-defined boundaries against the environment and the assumption of
decoherence are unnecessary for the characterization of measurements made by a
minimal observer. It is shown that the observables available to a minimal
observer are positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) and that the measurement
results reported by a minimal observer comply with the Born rule. The
differences in underlying physical assumptions between this ""systems-free""

"6324","Reconstruction of spatial qutrit states based on realistic measurement
  operators","Gen Taguchi|Tatsuo Dougakiuchi|Masataka Iinuma|Holger F. Hofmann|Yutaka Kadoya","  Spatial qudit states can be realized by using multi-slits to discretize the
transverse momentum of a photon. The merit of this kind of spatial qudit states
is that the implementation of higher dimensional qudits is relatively easy. As
we have recently shown, the quantum states of these spatial qudits can be
analyzed by scanning a single interference pattern. This method of single scan
tomography can also be applied at higher dimensions, but the reconstruction
becomes more sensitive to smaller details of the scanned patterns as the
dimensions increase. In this paper, we investigate the effect of finite
measurement resolution on the single scan tomography of spatial qutrits.
Realistic measurement operators describing the spatial resolution of the
measurement are introduced and the corresponding pattern functions for quantum
state reconstruction are derived. We use the pattern functions to analyze
experimental results for entangled pairs of spatial qutrits generated by
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). It is shown that a reliable
reconstruction of the quantum state can be achieved with finite measurement
resolution if this limitation of the measurement is included in the pattern
functions of single scan tomography.

particular gate library has been provided. Using that protocol, reversible
circuits for SR latch, D latch, JK latch and T latch are designed from NCT gate
library. All the circuits have been optimized with the help of existing local
optimization algorithms (e.g. template matching, moving rule and deletion
rule). It has been shown that the present proposals have lower gate
complexities, lower number of garbage bits, lower quantum cost and lower number
of feedback loops compared to the earlier proposals. For a fair comparison, the
optimized sequential circuits have been compared with the earlier proposals for
the same after converting the earlier proposed circuits into equivalent NCT
circuits. Further, we have shown that the advantage in gate count obtained in
some of the earlier proposals by introduction of New gates is an artifact and
if it is allowed then every reversible circuit block can be reduced to a single
gate. In this context, some important conceptual issues related to the
designing and optimization of sequential reversible circuits have been
addressed. A protocol for minimization of quantum cost of reversible circuit
has also been proposed here.

rigorously given for APN monitor, while for PNA, the analysis including
statistical fluctuation and random noise, is addressed with a confidence level.
The results show that the PNA can achieve better performance than the APN
monitor and can asymptotically approach the theoretical limit of the PND
monitor. Also, the passive scheme with the PNA works efficiently when the
signal-to-noise ratio ($R^{SN}$) is not too low and so is highly applicable to
solve the untrusted source problem in the QKD system.

fluctuation spectrum generates Casimir-like effective forces acting on its
confining surfaces. Near a continuous phase transition of such a medium the
corresponding order parameter fluctuations occur on all length scales and
therefore close to the critical point this effect acquires a universal
character, i.e., to a large extent it is independent of the microscopic details
of the actual system. Accordingly it can be calculated theoretically by
studying suitable representative model systems.
  We report on the direct measurement of critical Casimir forces by total
internal reflection microscopy (TIRM), with femto-Newton resolution. The
corresponding potentials are determined for individual colloidal particles
floating above a substrate under the action of the critical thermal noise in
the solvent medium, constituted by a binary liquid mixture of water and

adsorption preferences of the colloid and substrate surfaces with respect to
the two components of the binary liquid mixture, we observe that, upon
approaching the critical point of the solvent, attractive or repulsive forces
emerge and supersede those prevailing away from it. Based on the knowledge of
the critical Casimir forces acting in film geometries within the Ising
universality class and with equal or opposing boundary conditions, we provide
the corresponding theoretical predictions for the sphere-planar wall geometry

initially in $l$-photon coherent states. This system is described by two-mode
multiphoton (, i.e., $k_1, k_2$) Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). For this system
we investigate the occurrence of the revival-collapse phenomenon (RCP) in the
evolution of the single-mode, two-mode, sum and difference quadrature
squeezing. We show that there is a class of states for which all these types of

partial information on that case. Moreover, we show that single-mode, two-mode

that both quantum entanglement and non-locality (i.e., correlations that
violate Bell-type inequalities) have limited shareability properties and can
sometimes even be monogamous. We give a self-contained review of these results

Further, the relationship between sharing non-local quantum correlations and
sharing mixed entangled states is investigated, and already for the simplest

Also, a recently proposed new interpretation of Bell's theorem by Schumacher in

of an unstable state in the long time region is considered. In 1957 Khalfin
proved that this amplitude tends to zero as $t\to\infty$ more slowly than any
exponential function of $t$. For a time-dependent decay rate $\gamma(t)$
Khalfin's result means that this $\gamma(t)$ is not a constant for large $t$
but that it tends to zero as $t\to\infty$. We find that a similar conclusion
can be drawn for the instantaneous energy of the unstable state for a large
class of models of unstable states: This energy tends to the minimal energy of
the system ${\cal E}_{min}$ as $t\to\infty$ which is much smaller than the
energy of this state for $t$ of the order of the lifetime of the considered
state. Analyzing the transition time region between exponential and
non-exponential form of the survival amplitude we find that the instantaneous
energy of a considered unstable state can take large values, much larger than
the energy of this state for $t$ from the exponential time region. Taking into
account results obtained for a model considered, it is hypothesized that this
purely quantum mechanical effect may be responsible for the properties of broad

equations are both widely used to describe the dynamics of open quantum
systems. The connection between these two descriptions is a classic topic in
mathematical physics. One direction was solved by the now famous result due to
Lindblad, Kossakowski Gorini and Sudarshan, who gave a complete
characterisation of the master equations that generate completely positive
semi-groups. However, the other direction has remained open: given a CPT map,
is there a Lindblad master equation that generates it (and if so, can we find
it's form)? This is sometimes known as the Markovianity problem. Physically, it
is asking how one can deduce underlying physical processes from experimental
observations.
  We give a complexity theoretic answer to this problem: it is NP-hard. We also
give an explicit algorithm that reduces the problem to integer semi-definite
programming, a well-known NP problem. Together, these results imply that
resolving the question of which CPT maps can be generated by master equations
is tantamount to solving P=NP: any efficiently computable criterion for
Markovianity would imply P=NP; whereas a proof that P=NP would imply that our
algorithm already gives an efficiently computable criterion. Thus, unless P
does equal NP, there cannot exist any simple criterion for determining when a
CPT map has a master equation description.
  However, we also show that if the system dimension is fixed (relevant for
current quantum process tomography experiments), then our algorithm scales
efficiently in the required precision, allowing an underlying Lindblad master
equation to be determined efficiently from even a single snapshot in this case.
  Our work also leads to similar complexity-theoretic answers to a related
long-standing open problem in probability theory.

those who are allowed to use arbitrary strategies, not limited to local

between them. Study of multi-prover interactive proof systems with no-signaling
provers is motivated by study of those with provers sharing quantum states. The
relation between them is that no-signaling strategies include all the
strategies realizable by provers sharing arbitrary entangled quantum states,

  This paper shows that two-prover one-round interactive proof systems with
no-signaling provers only accept languages in PSPACE. Combined with the
protocol for PSPACE by Ito, Kobayashi and Matsumoto (CCC 2009), this implies
MIPns(2,1)=PSPACE, where MIPns(2,1) is the class of languages having a
two-prover one-round interactive proof system with no-signaling provers. This
is proved by constructing a fast parallel algorithm which approximates within
an additive error the maximum value of a two-player one-round game achievable
by cooperative no-signaling players. The algorithm uses the fast parallel
algorithm for the mixed packing and covering problem by Young (FOCS 2001).

  Continuous Variables","Masahiro Hotta","  It is well known that usual quantum teleportation protocols cannot transport
energy. Recently, new protocols called quantum energy teleportation (QET) have
been proposed, which transport energy by local operations and classical
communication with the ground states of many-body quantum systems. In this
paper, we compare two different QET protocols for transporting energy with
electromagnetic field. In the first protocol, a 1/2 spin (a qubit) is coupled
with the quantum fluctuation in the vacuum state and measured in order to
obtain one-bit information about the fluctuation for the teleportation. In the
second protocol, a harmonic oscillator is coupled with the fluctuation and
measured in order to obtain continuous-variable information about the
fluctuation. In the spin protocol, the amount of teleported energy is
suppressed by an exponential damping factor when the amount of input energy
increases. This suppression factor becomes power damping in the case of the
harmonic oscillator protocol. Therefore, it is concluded that obtaining more
information about the quantum fluctuation leads to teleporting more energy.
This result suggests a profound relationship between energy and quantum
information.

  problems","Boris Altshuler|Hari Krovi|Jeremie Roland","  Adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted a lot of attention because small
scale simulations gave hope that it would allow to solve NP-complete problems
efficiently. Later, negative results proved the existence of specifically
designed hard instances where adiabatic optimization requires exponential time.
In spite of this, there was still hope that this would not happen for random
instances of NP-complete problems. This is an important issue since random
instances are a good model for hard instances that can not be solved by current
classical solvers, for which an efficient quantum algorithm would therefore be
desirable. Here, we will show that because of a phenomenon similar to Anderson
localization, an exponentially small eigenvalue gap appears in the spectrum of
the adiabatic Hamiltonian for large random instances, very close to the end of
the algorithm. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization
also fails for these instances by getting stuck in a local minimum, unless the
computation is exponentially long.

speed of a phonon in the crystal. A probe qubit is strongly coupled with phonon
fluctuation in the ground state for a short time, and it is projectively

the measurement process, phonons are excited by the time-dependent measurement

left edge do not arrive at the right edge at the same time as when the
information arrives at the right edge, we are able to soon extract energy from
the ions at the right edge by using the transferred information. Because the
intermediate ions of the crystal are not excited during the execution of the
protocol, energy is transmitted in the energy transfer channel without heat

can be described in terms of their relative phase, treated as a random unknown
variable. This phase can be understood, either as emerging from the
measurements, or preexisting to them; in the latter case, the originating
states could be phase states with unknown phases, so that an average over all
their possible values is taken. Both points of view lead to a description of
probabilities of results of experiments in terms of a phase angle, which plays
the role of a classical variable. Nevertheless, in some situations, this
description is not sufficient: another variable, which we call the ""quantum
angle"", emerges from the theory. This article studies various manifestations of
the quantum angle. We first introduce the quantum angle by expressing two Fock
states crossing a beam splitter in terms of phase states, and relate the
quantum angle to off-diagonal matrix elements in the phase representation. Then
we consider an experiment with two beam splitters, where two experimenters make
dichotomic measurements with two interferometers and detectors that are far
apart; the results lead to violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality (valid for local-realistic theories, including classical
descriptions of the phase). Finally, we discuss an experiment where particles
from each of two sources are either deviated via a beam splitter to a side
collector or proceed to the point of interference. For a given interference
result, we find ""population oscillations"" in the distributions of the deviated
particles, which are entirely controlled by the quantum angle. Various versions
of population oscillation experiments are discussed, with two or three
independent condensates.

such a model into a genuine quantum field theory, obeying the usual conditions

constructed exactly as in quantum theories.
  This raises the question whether such models allow Bell's inequalities to be
violated. Being a local, deterministic theory, one would argue that this is
impossible, but since at large distance scales the model does not seem to
differ from real quantum field theories, there is reason to wonder why it
should not allow entangled states. The standard arguments concerning Bell's

radiation loss) for non-classical, dual-mode entangled states is derived from
first principles, using an infinite-series of beam splitters to model
continuous photon loss. This model is general enough to accommodate
stray-photon noise along the propagation, as well as amplitude attenuation. An
explicit analytical expression for the density matrix as a function of
propagation distance is obtained for completely general input states with

studies. However, for generic input states, where the coefficients are
generated randomly, the decay of coherence is very different; in fact no worse
than the classical Beer-Lambert law. More surprisingly, there is a plateu at a
mid-range interval in propagation distance where the loss is in fact
sub-classical, following which it resumes the classical rate. The qualitative
behavior of the decay of entanglement for two-mode propagation is also analyzed

  is self-consistent: the slightly stronger canonical commutation rule Dirac
  missed","Steven Kenneth Kauffmann","  Dirac's identification of the quantum analog of the Poisson bracket with the
commutator is reviewed, as is the threat of self-inconsistent overdetermination
of the quantization of classical dynamical variables which drove him to
restrict the assumption of correspondence between quantum and classical Poisson
brackets to embrace only the Cartesian components of the phase space vector.
Dirac's canonical commutation rule fails to determine the order of noncommuting
factors within quantized classical dynamical variables, but does imply the
quantum/classical correspondence of Poisson brackets between any linear
function of phase space and the sum of an arbitrary function of only
configuration space with one of only momentum space. Since every linear
function of phase space is itself such a sum, it is worth checking whether the
assumption of quantum/classical correspondence of Poisson brackets for all such
sums is still self-consistent. Not only is that so, but this slightly stronger
canonical commutation rule also unambiguously determines the order of
noncommuting factors within quantized dynamical variables in accord with the
1925 Born-Jordan quantization surmise, thus replicating the results of the
Hamiltonian path integral, a fact first realized by E. H. Kerner. Born-Jordan
quantization validates the generalized Ehrenfest theorem, but has no inverse,
which disallows the disturbing features of the poorly physically motivated
invertible Weyl quantization, i.e., its unique deterministic classical ""shadow

  multipartite entangled states","A. Osterloh|J. Siewert","  The invariant-comb approach is a method to construct entanglement measures
for multipartite systems of qubits. The essential step is the construction of
an antilinear operator that we call {\em comb} in reference to the {\em
hairy-ball theorem}. An appealing feature of this approach is that for qubits
(or spins 1/2) the combs are automatically invariant under $SL(2,\CC)$, which
implies that the obtained invariants are entanglement monotones by
construction. By asking which property of a state determines whether or not it
is detected by a polynomial $SL(2,\CC)$ invariant we find that it is the
presence of a {\em balanced part} that persists under local unitary
transformations. We present a detailed analysis for the maximally entangled
states detected by such polynomial invariants, which leads to the concept of
{\em irreducibly balanced} states. The latter indicates a tight connection with
SLOCC classifications of qubit entanglement. \\ Combs may also help to define
measures for multipartite entanglement of higher-dimensional subsystems.
However, for higher spins there are many independent combs such that it is
non-trivial to find an invariant one. By restricting the allowed local
operations to rotations of the coordinate system (i.e. again to the
$SL(2,\CC)$) we manage to define a unique extension of the concurrence to
general half-integer spin with an analytic convex-roof expression for mixed

Nevertheless, it is often argued that most of the states of the Hilbert space

regarded as a node ($n$) of the network; The transition rates ($w_{mn}$)
between the nodes are regarded as the elements of a random matrix that
describes the network. If the size-distribution of the connecting elements is
wide (e.g. log-normal-like rather than Gaussian-like) the result for the
absorption coefficient differs enormously from the conventional Kubo prediction

for the analysis. In particular we apply this approach to obtain practical
approximations for the conductance of mesoscopic rings. In this context Mott's

quantum probing is understood as a pre-measurement based on a non-demolition

denotes parity and T denotes time reversal. All prior work has focused on the
case that time reversal is even (T^2 = 1). We generalize the formalism to the
case of odd time reversal (T^2 = -1). We discover an analogue of Kramer's

quantum system with odd time reversal, and discuss potential applications of
the formalism. Odd time reversal symmetry applies to fermionic systems
including quarks and leptons and a plethora of models in nuclear, atomic and

fundamental physics beyond the standard model or for the effective description

However, relaxing the constraint that in particular the mass matrix be
Hermitian also allows for models that have no counterpart in conventional
quantum mechanics. For example it is well-known that a quartet of Weyl spinors
coupled by a Hermitian mass matrix reduces to two independent Dirac fermions;
here we show that the same quartet of Weyl spinors, when coupled by a

the mass matrix is non-zero.The ${\cal PT}$-generalized Dirac equation is also
Lorentz invariant, unitary in time, and CPT respecting, even though as a

proposed reconciliation of general relativity and quantum field theory is based
on a modification of their graphical instantiations, i.e., Regge calculus and
lattice gauge theory, respectively, which we assume are fundamental to their
continuum counterparts. Accordingly, the fundamental structure is a graphical
amalgam of space, time, and sources (in parlance of quantum field theory)
called a ""spacetimesource element."" These are fundamental elements of space,
time, and sources, not source elements in space and time. The transition
amplitude for a spacetimesource element is computed using a path integral with
discrete graphical action. The action for a spacetimesource element is
constructed from a difference matrix K and source vector J on the graph, as in
lattice gauge theory. K is constructed from graphical field gradients so that
it contains a non-trivial null space and J is then restricted to the row space
of K, so that it is divergence-free and represents a conserved exchange of
energy-momentum. This construct of K and J represents an adynamical global
constraint between sources, the spacetime metric, and the energy-momentum
content of the element, rather than a dynamical law for time-evolved entities.
We use this approach via modified Regge calculus to correct proper distance in
the Einstein-deSitter cosmology model yielding a fit of the Union2 Compilation
supernova data that matches LambdaCDM without having to invoke accelerating
expansion or dark energy. A similar modification to lattice gauge theory

continuous-time quantum and classical random walk respectively. This results
illustrate the decay of quantum mechanical transport processes is quicker than
that of the classical one. Due to the result, the characteristic time $t_c$,
which is the time when the first maximum of the probabilities occur on an
infinite graph, for the quantum walk is shorter than that of the classical

is faster than that of the classical one. In the end, we investigate the

quantum system (in particular, between the actual evolution of an open system
and the ideal target operation on the corresponding closed system) is important
in quantum control, especially in control of quantum information processing.
Motivated by this problem, we develop a measure for evaluating the distance
between unitary evolution operators of a composite quantum system that consists
of a sub-system of interest (e.g., a quantum information processor) and
environment. The main characteristic of this measure is the invariance with
respect to the effect of the evolution operator on the environment, which
follows from an equivalence relation that exists between unitary operators
acting on the composite system, when the effect on only the sub-system of
interest is considered. The invariance to the environment's transformation
makes it possible to quantitatively compare the evolution of an open quantum
system and its closed counterpart. The distance measure also determines the
fidelity bounds of a general quantum channel (a completely positive and
trace-preserving map acting on the sub-system of interest) with respect to a
unitary target transformation. This measure is also independent of the initial
state of the system and straightforward to numerically calculate. As an
example, the measure is used in numerical simulations to evaluate fidelities of
optimally controlled quantum gate operations (for one- and two-qubit systems),
in the presence of a decohering environment. This example illustrates the
utility of this measure for optimal control of quantum operations in the
realistic case of open-system dynamics.

access structures of such schemes can be characterized by an excluded minor

While previous work has shown how to construct quantum secret sharing schemes

In this context the present results prove to be useful; they enable us to

characterization and detection in fermionic two-particle interferometers at
finite temperature. The motivation for our work is provided by the recent

the two particle interferometer proposed by Samuelsson, Sukhorukov, and
Buttiker, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 026805 (2004). The experiment displayed a clear
two-particle Aharonov-Bohm effect, however with an amplitude suppressed due to
finite temperature and dephasing. This raised qualitative as well quantitative
questions about entanglement production and detection in mesoscopic conductors
at finite temperature. As a response to these questions, in our recent work,
Samuelsson, Neder, and Buttiker, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 106804 (2009) we
presented a general theory for finite temperature entanglement in mesoscopic
conductors. Applied to the two-particle interferometer we showed that the
emitted two-particle state in the experiment was clearly entangled. Moreover,
we demonstrated that the entanglement of the reduced two-particle state,
reconstructed from measurements of average currents and current cross
correlations, constitutes a lower bound to the entanglement of the emitted
state. The present work provides an extended and more detailed discussion of
these findings.

optimality defined based on entanglement fidelity. For the practically useful
case of codes encoding a single qubit of information, our algorithm is

  Three-Qubit States","Sayatnova Tamaryan|Hungsoo Kim|Mu-Seong Kim|Kap Soo Jang|DaeKil Park","  Any pure three-qubit state is uniquely characterized by one phase and four
positive parameters. The geometric measure of entanglement as a function of
state parameters can have different expressions. Each of expressions has its
own applicable domain and thus the whole state parameter space is divided into
subspaces that are ranges of definition for corresponding expressions. The
purpose of this paper is to examine the applicable domains for the most general
qubit-interchange symmetric three-qubit states. First, we compute the
eigenvalues of the non-linear eigenvalue equations and the nearest separable
states for the permutation invariant three-qubit states with a fixed phase.
Next, we compute the geometric entanglement measure, deduce the boundaries of
all subspaces, and find allocations of highly and slightly entangled states. It
is shown that there are three applicable domains when the phase factor is
$\pi/2$ while other cases have only two domains. The emergence of the three
domains is due to the appearance of the additional W-state. We show that most
of highly entangled states reside near the boundaries of the domains and states
located far from the boundaries become less-entangled and eventually go to the
product states. The neighbors of W-state are generally more entangled than the
neighbors of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) state from the aspect of the
geometric measure. However, the range of the GHZ-neighbors is much more wider
than the range of the W-neighbors.

  point operators","S. Chaturvedi|N. Mukunda|R. Simon","  We set up Wigner distributions for $N$ state quantum systems following a
Dirac inspired approach. In contrast to much of the work on this case,
requiring a $2N\times 2N$ phase space, particularly when $N$ is even, our
approach is uniformly based on an $N\times N $ phase space grid and thereby
avoids the necessity of having to invoke a `quadrupled' phase space and hence
the attendant redundance. Both $N$ odd and even cases are analysed in detail
and it is found that there are striking differences between the two. While the
$N$ odd case permits full implementation of the marginals property, the even
case does so only in a restricted sense. This has the consequence that in the
even case one is led to several equally good definitions of the Wigner
distributions as opposed to the odd case where the choice turns out to be
unique.

  languages","Daowen Qiu|Lvzhou Li|Paulo Mateus|Amilcar Sernadas","  We show that there are quantum devices that accept all regular languages and
that are exponentially more concise than deterministic finite automata (DFA).
For this purpose, we introduce a new computing model of {\it one-way quantum
finite automata} (1QFA), namely, {\it one-way quantum finite automata together
with classical states} (1QFAC), which extends naturally both measure-only 1QFA
and DFA and whose state complexity is upper-bounded by both. The original
contributions of the paper are the following. First, we show that the set of
languages accepted by 1QFAC with bounded error consists precisely of all
regular languages. Second, we prove that 1QFAC are at most exponentially more
concise than DFA. Third, we show that the previous bound is tight for families
of regular languages that are not recognized by measure-once (RMO),
measure-many (RMM) and multi-letter 1QFA. % More concretely we exhibit regular
languages $L^0(m)$ for $m$ prime such that: (i) $L^0(m)$ cannot be recognized
by measure-once, measure-many and multi-letter 1QFA; (ii) the minimal DFA that
accepts $L^0(m)$ has $O(m)$ states; (iii) there is a 1QFAC with constant
classical states and $O(\log(m))$ quantum basis that accepts $L^0(m)$. Fourth,
we give a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether any two 1QFAC are
equivalent. Finally, we show that state minimization of 1QFAC is decidable
within EXPSPACE. We conclude the paper by posing some open problems.

Klein-Gordon equation for the free-moving hadron and a harmonic oscillator
equation for the quarks inside the hadron. However, their solution of the
oscillator equation is not consistent with the existing rules of quantum
mechanics and special relativity. On the other hand, their partial differential
equation has many other solutions depending on boundary conditions. It is noted
that there is a Lorentz-covariant set of solutions totally consistent with
quantum mechanics and special relativity. This set constitutes a representation
of the Poincar\'e group which dictates the fundamental space-time symmetry of
particles in the Lorentz-covariant world. It is then shown that the same set of
solutions can be used as the mathematical basis for two-photon coherent states
or squeezed states in quantum optics. It is thus possible to transmit the
physics of squeezed states into the hadronic world. While the time-like
separation is the most puzzling problem in the covariant oscillator regime,
this variable can be interpreted like the unobserved photon in the two-mode

fact that multiple matter-wave dark solitons may naturally form in such
settings as per our recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 130401 (2008)]. First,
we study the dark soliton interactions and show that the dynamics of
well-separated solitons (i.e., ones that undergo a collision with relatively
low velocities) can be analyzed by means of particle-like equations of motion.
The latter take into regard the repulsion between solitons (via an effective
repulsive potential) and the confinement and dimensionality of the system (via
an effective parabolic trap for each soliton). Next, based on the fact that
stationary, well-separated dark multi-soliton states emerge as a nonlinear
continuation of the appropriate excited eigensates of the quantum harmonic
oscillator, we use a Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis to systematically study the
stability of such structures. We find that for a sufficiently large number of
atoms, multiple soliton states may be dynamically stable, while for a small
number of atoms, we predict a dynamical instability emerging from resonance
effects between the eigenfrequencies of the soliton modes and the intrinsic
excitation frequencies of the condensate. Finally we present experimental
realizations of multi-soliton states including a three-soliton state consisting
of two solitons oscillating around a stationary one.

environment consisting of a degenerate bosonic quantum gas. The impurity atoms
differ from the environment atoms, being of a different species. This allows
one to superimpose two independent trapping potentials, each being effective
only on one atomic kind, while transparent to the other. When the environment
is homogeneous and the impurities are confined in a potential consisting of a
set of double wells, the system can be described in terms of an effective
spin-boson model, where the occupation of the left or right well of each site
represents the two (pseudo)-spin states. The irreversible dynamics of such
system is here studied exactly, i.e., not in terms of a Markovian master
equation. The dynamics of one and two impurities is remarkably different in
respect of the standard decoherence of the spin - boson system. In particular
we show: i) the appearance of coherence oscillations, i) the presence of super
and sub decoherent states which differ from the standard ones of the spin boson
model, and iii) the persistence of coherence in the system at long times. We
show that this behaviour is due to the fact that the pseudospins have an
internal spatial structure. We argue that collective decoherence also prompts
information about the correlation length of the environment. In a one
dimensional configuration one can change even stronger the qualitative
behaviour of the dephasing just by tuning the interaction of the bath.

(CQT), as developed by Griffiths and others over the past 25 years. The theory
is a version of orthodox(Copenhagen) quantum mechanics, based on the notion
that the unique and mysterious feature of quantum, as opposed to classical,
systems is the simultaneous existence of multiple incompatible representations
of reality, referred to as ""frameworks"". A framework is a maximal set of
properties of a system for which probabilities can be consistently defined.
This notion is expressed by saying that a framework provides an exhaustive set
of exclusive alternatives (ESEA), but no single framework suffices to fully
characterize a quantum system. Indeed, the existence of multiple incompatible
frameworks is the hallmark of quantum mechanical behavior. Any prediction of
the theory must be confined to a single framework and combining elements from
different frameworks leads to quantum mechanically meaningless statements. This
""single framework rule"" is the precise mathematical statement of Bohr's
complementarity. It is shown that if the microscopic description is assumed to
incorporate these elements in a local setting, then distant entanglements,
macroscopic measurements, wave function collapse and other mysterious features
of quantum behavior follow in a logical manner. The essential elements of the
theory are first explained using the simplest quantum system, a single spin-1/2
degree of freedom at one time.

seen that for the maximally entangled initial state in the presence of
decoherence, the quantum phases strongly influence the payoffs for various
sequences of the game. The effect of amplitude damping channel leads to winning
payoffs. Whereas the depolarizing and phase damping channels lead to the losing
payoffs. In case of amplitude damping channel, the payoffs are enhanced in the
presence of decoherence for the sequence AAB. This is because the quantum
phases interfere constructively which leads to the quantum enhancement of the
payoffs in comparison to the undecohered case. It is also seen that the quantum
phase angles damp the payoffs significantly in the presence of decoherence.
Furthermore, it is seen that for multiple games of sequence AAB, under the
influence of amplitude damping channel, the game still remains a winning game.
However, the quantum enhancement reduces in comparison to the single game of
sequence AAB because of the destructive interference of phase dependent terms.
In case of depolarizing channel, the game becomes a loosing game. It is seen
that for the game sequence B the game is loosing one and the behavior of
sequences B and BB is similar for amplitude damping and depolarizing channels.
In addition, the repeated games of A are only influenced by the amplitude
damping channel and the game remains a losing game. Furthermore, it is also
seen that for any sequence when played in series, the phase damping channel
does not influence the game.

to the existence of Yukawian forces - predicted in the submillimeter range by
many unification models - from Casimir force experiments using the sphere-plane
geometry. Two forms of this approximation are discussed, the first used in most
analyses of the residuals from the Casimir force experiments performed so far,
and the second recently discussed in this context in R. Decca et al. [Phys.
Rev. D 79, 124021 (2009)]. We show that the former form of the proximity force
approximation overestimates the expected Yukawa force and that the relative
deviation from the exact Yukawa force is of the same order of magnitude, in the
realistic experimental settings, as the relative deviation expected between the
exact Casimir force and the Casimir force evaluated in the proximity force
approximation. This implies both a systematic shift making the actual limits to
the Yukawa force weaker than claimed so far, and a degree of uncertainty in the
alpha-lambda plane related to the handling of the various approximations used
in the theory for both the Casimir and the Yukawa forces. We further argue that
the recently discussed form for the proximity force approximation is
equivalent, for a geometry made of a generic object interacting with an
infinite planar slab, to the usual exact integration of any additive two-body
interaction, without any need to invoke approximation schemes. If the planar
slab is of finite size, an additional source of systematic error arises due to
the breaking of the planar translational invariance of the system, and we
finally discuss to what extent this may affect limits obtained on power-law and
Yukawa forces.

information theory and quantum chaos. Moreover, a detailed study of their
properties can shed light on some foundational issues of the quantum
statistical mechanics such as the emergence of well defined thermal properties
from the pure quantum mechanical description of large many body systems. When
dealing with an ensemble of pure quantum states, two questions naturally arise:
what is the probability density function on the parameters which specify the
state of the system in a given ensemble? And, does there exist a most typical
value of a function of interest in the considered ensemble? Here two different
ensembles are considered: the Random Pure State Ensemble (RPSE) and the Fixed
Expectation Energy Ensemble (FEEE). By means of a suitable parameterization of
the wave function in terms of populations and phases, we focus on the
probability distribution of the populations in such ensembles. A comparison is
made between the distribution induced by the inherent geometry of the Hilbert
Space and an approximate distribution derived by means of the minimization of
the informational functional. While the latter can be analytically handled, the
exact geometrical distribution is sampled by a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
The analysis is made for an ensemble of wavefunctions describing an ideal
system composed of n spins 1/2 and reveals the salient differences between the
geometrical and the approximate distributions. The analytical approximations
are proven to be useful tools in order to obtain ensemble averaged quantity. In
particular we focus on the distribution of the Shannon entropy by providing an
explanation of the emergence of a typical value of this quantity in the

"7230","On the communication complexity of XOR functions","Ashley Montanaro|Tobias Osborne","  An XOR function is a function of the form g(x,y) = f(x + y), for some boolean
function f on n bits. We study the quantum and classical communication
complexity of XOR functions. In the case of exact protocols, we completely
characterise one-way communication complexity for all f. We also show that,
when f is monotone, g's quantum and classical complexities are quadratically
related, and that when f is a linear threshold function, g's quantum complexity
is Theta(n). More generally, we make a structural conjecture about the Fourier
spectra of boolean functions which, if true, would imply that the quantum and
classical exact communication complexities of all XOR functions are
asymptotically equivalent. We give two randomised classical protocols for
general XOR functions which are efficient for certain functions, and a third
protocol for linear threshold functions with high margin. These protocols
operate in the symmetric message passing model with shared randomness.

Neither the preparation nor the post-selection of the ancilla spin state is

investigated, by scrutinizing the effects of imperfections in the incident wave

problem from classical to quantum computation. This problem is shown to be
surprisingly hard: it is complete for the class QIP of problems that have
quantum interactive proof systems, which implies that it is hard for the class
PSPACE of problems solvable by a classical computation in polynomial space.
  Several restrictions of distinguishability are also shown to be hard. It is
no easier when restricted to quantum computations of logarithmic depth, to
mixed-unitary channels, to degradable channels, or to antidegradable channels.
These hardness results are demonstrated by finding reductions between these
classes of quantum channels. These techniques have applications outside the
distinguishability problem, as the construction for mixed-unitary channels is
used to prove that the additivity problem for the classical capacity of quantum
channels can be equivalently restricted to the mixed unitary channels.

when emission ends in a superposition of multiple final states, correlation
between different pathways may build up if the ""which-way"" information is not
fully resolved (i.e., the emission spectrum is broader than the transition
energy range). Such correlation can be exploited for spin-flip control in a
$\Lambda$-type three-level system, which manifests itself as an all-optical
spin echo in nonlinear optics with two orders of optical fields saved as

of the heralded state. In this paper, we investigate spectral entanglement
between the two output modes of a periodically poled waveguide. With the intent
of generating heralded 1- and 2-photon Fock states, we expand the output state

filtering and inefficient detection, of the heralding mode, on the count rate,
g(2) and purity of the heralded state, as well as the fidelity between the

spectral correlations, however, at the expense of the count rate and increased

model a type II PP-KTP waveguide pumped by lasers at wavelengths of 400 nm, 788

forefront in terms of implementations. As such they represent an excellent
opportunity to move towards integrated protocols involving many of these
elements. In this paper we look at expressing and extending graph state secret
sharing and MBQC in a common framework and graphical language related to flow.
We do so with two main contributions.
  First we express in entirely graphical terms which set of players can access
which information in graph state secret sharing protocols. These succinct
graphical descriptions of access allow us to take known results from graph
theory to make statements on the generalisation of the previous schemes to
present new secret sharing protocols.
  Second, we give a set of necessary conditions as to when a graph with flow,
i.e. capable of performing a class of unitary operations, can be extended to
include vertices which can be ignored, pointless measurements, and hence
considered as unauthorised players in terms of secret sharing, or error qubits
in terms of fault tolerance. This offers a way to extend existing MBQC patterns
to secret sharing protocols. Our characterisation of pointless measurements is
believed also to be a useful tool for further integrated measurement based

"4029","Quantum control and measurement of atomic spins in polarization
  spectroscopy","Ivan H. Deutsch|Poul S. Jessen","  Quantum control and measurement are two sides of the same coin. To affect a
dynamical map, well-designed time-dependent control fields must be applied to
the system of interest. To read out the quantum state, information about the
system must be transferred to a probe field. We study a particular example of
this dual action in the context of quantum control and measurement of atomic
spins through the light-shift interaction with an off-resonant optical probe.
By introducing an irreducible tensor decomposition, we identify the coupling of
the Stokes vector of the light field with moments of the atomic spin state.
This shows how polarization spectroscopy can be used for continuous weak
measurement of atomic observables that evolve as a function of time.
Simultaneously, the state-dependent light shift induced by the probe field can
drive nonlinear dynamics of the spin, and can be used to generate arbitrary
unitary transformations on the atoms. We revisit the derivation of the master
equation in order to give a unified description of spin dynamics in the
presence of both nonlinear dynamics and photon scattering. Based on this
formalism, we review applications to quantum control, including the design of
state-to-state mappings, and quantum-state reconstruction via continuous weak
measurement on a dynamically controlled ensemble.

"4231","The Theory of (Exclusively) Local Beables","Travis Norsen","  It is shown how, starting with the de Broglie - Bohm pilot-wave theory, one
can construct a new theory of the sort envisioned by several of QM's founders:
a Theory of Exclusively Local Beables (TELB). In particular, the usual quantum
mechanical wave function (a function on a high-dimensional configuration space)
is not among the beables posited by the new theory. Instead, each particle has
an associated ``pilot-wave'' field (living in physical space). A number of
additional fields (also fields on physical space) maintain what is described,
in ordinary quantum theory, as ``entanglement.'' The theory allows some
interesting new perspective on the kind of causation involved in pilot-wave
theories in general. And it provides also a concrete example of an empirically
viable quantum theory in whose formulation the wave function (on configuration
space) does not appear -- i.e., it is a theory according to which nothing
corresponding to the configuration space wave function need actually exist.
That is the theory's \emph{raison d'etre} and perhaps its only virtue. Its
vices include the fact that it only reproduces the empirical predictions of the
ordinary pilot-wave theory (equivalent, of course, to the predictions of
ordinary quantum theory) for spinless non-relativistic particles, and only then
for wave functions that are everywhere analytic. The goal is thus not to
recommend the TELB proposed here as a replacement for ordinary pilot-wave
theory (or ordinary quantum theory), but is rather to illustrate (with a crude
first stab) that it might be possible to construct a plausible, empirically
viable TELB, and to recommend this as an interesting and perhaps-fruitful
program for future research.

noncommutative probability in the framework of topological superalgebras; it
includes, besides NHM basics, a treatment of Lie group actions in NHM and
noncommutative analogues of the momentum map, Poincar$\acute{e}$-Cartan form
and the symplectic version of Noether's theorem. Canonically induced symplectic
structure on the (skew) tensor product of two symplectic superalgebras (needed
in the description of interaction between systems) is shown to exist if and
only if either both system superalgebras are supercommutative or both
non-supercommutative with a `quantum symplectic structure' characterized by a
\emph{universal} Planck type constant; the presence of such a universal
constant is, therefore, \emph{dictated} by the formalism. This provides proper
foundation for an autonomous development of quantum mechanics as a universal

Unnikrishnan has suggested that a dynamical interaction leading to the SSC

than quantum mechanics, with particular reference to the notion of information
causality recently proposed by Pawlowski et. al. (arXiv:0905.2992). We consider
two entropic quantities, which we term measurement and mixing entropy. In
classical and quantum theory, they are equal, being given by the Shannon and
von Neumann entropies respectively; in general, however, they are very
different. In particular, while measurement entropy is easily seen to be
concave, mixing entropy need not be. In fact, as we show, mixing entropy is not
concave whenever the state space is a non-simplicial polytope. Thus, the
condition that measurement and mixing entropies coincide is a strong constraint
on possible theories. We call theories with this property monoentropic.
Measurement entropy is subadditive, but not in general strongly subadditive.
Equivalently, if we define the mutual information between two systems A and B
by the usual formula I(A:B) = H(A) + H(B) - H(AB) where H denotes the
measurement entropy and AB is a non-signaling composite of A and B, then it can
happen that I(A:BC) < I(A:B). This is relevant to information causality in the
sense of Pawlowski et al.: we show that any monoentropic non-signaling theory
in which measurement entropy is strongly subadditive, and also satisfies a
version of the Holevo bound, is informationally causal, and on the other hand
we observe that Popescu-Rohrlich boxes, which violate information causality,
also violate strong subadditivity. We also explore the interplay between
measurement and mixing entropy and various natural conditions on theories that
arise in quantum axiomatics.

Neuhauser's result, that with the appropriate choice of phases the standard (or

holds for the anti-unitary operators of the extended group. We also improve on
Neuhauser's result by giving explicit formulae for the (anti-)unitary

the eigenvalues and the order of an arbitrary (anti-)symplectic matrix. The
fact that in prime power dimension the matrix elements belong to a field means
that this can be done using the same techniques which are used to find the
eigenvalues of a matrix defined over the reals-including the use of an
extension field (the analogue of the complex numbers) when the eigenvalues are
not in the base field. We then give an application of these results to
SIC-POVMs (symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued

natural basis for the eigenspace of the Zauner unitary in which SIC-fiducials

is called entangled if the players are allowed to share a priori entanglement.
It is well-known that the maximum winning probability (value) of entangled
XOR-games (binary games in which the predetermined property depends only on the
XOR of the two output bits) can be computed by a semidefinite program. In this
paper we extend this result in the following sense; if a binary game is
uniform, meaning that in an optimal strategy the marginal distributions of the
output of each player are uniform, then its entangled value can be efficiently
computed by a semidefinite program. We also introduce a lower bound on the
entangled value of a general two-player one-round game; this bound depends on
the size of the output set of each player and can be computed by a semidefinite
program. In particular, we show that if the game is binary, w_q is its

quantum particles is discussed. We are in particular interested in a realistic
description requiring as little prior knowledge about the system as possible.
Thus, unlike in previous studies, we consider the case of an arbitrary relative
orientation of the two atoms. For this, we model the atom with complete Zeeman
manifolds, and include parallel as well as orthogonal dipole-dipole couplings
between all states of the two atoms. We find that it is possible to determine
the distance of the two atoms independent of the orientation, as long as the
particles are sufficiently close to each other. Next, we discuss how in
addition the alignment of the atoms can be measured. For this, we focus on the
two cases of atoms in a two-dimensional waveguide and of atoms on a surface.

between the target and output states cannot be perfect. In order for an RSP
experiment to demonstrate genuine quantum advantages, it must surpass the
optimal threshold of a comparable classical protocol. Here we study the
fidelity achievable by RSP protocols lacking shared entanglement, and determine
the optimal value for the average fidelity in several different cases. We
implement an experimental scheme for deterministic remote preparation of
arbitrary photon polarization qubits, preparing 178 different pure and mixed

different patterns of site-dependent interaction couplings, singling out two
general settings: Patterns that allow for perfect long-distance entanglement

single periodicity, it is possible to realize models endowed with nonvanishing
LDE or QLDE. We then study how to realize models that optimize the robustness
of QLDE at finite temperature and in the presence of imperfections using

"3232","Quantum Physics, Relativity, and Complex Spacetime: Towards a New
  Synthesis","Gerald Kaiser","  The positivity of the energy in relativistic quantum mechanics implies that
wave functions can be continued analytically to the forward tube T in complex
spacetime. For Klein-Gordon particles, we interpret T as an extended (8D)
classical phase space containing all 6D classical phase spaces as symplectic
submanifolds. The evaluation maps $e_z: f\to f(z)$ of wave functions on T are
relativistic coherent states reducing to the Gaussian coherent states in the
nonrelativistic limit. It is known that no covariant probability interpretation
exists for Klein-Gordon particles in real spacetime because the time component
of the conserved ""probability current"" can attain negative values even for
positive-energy solutions. We show that this problem is solved very naturally
in complex spacetime, where $|f(x-iy)|^2$ is interpreted as a probability
density on all 6D phase spaces in T which, when integrated over the ""momentum""
variables y, gives a conserved spacetime probability current whose time
component is a positive regularization of the usual one. Similar results are
obtained for Dirac particles, where the evaluation maps $e_z$ are spinor-valued
relativistic coherent states. For free quantized Klein-Gordon and Dirac fields,
the above formalism extends to n-particle/antiparticle coherent states whose
scalar products are Wightman functions. The 2-point function plays the role of
a reproducing kernel for the one-particle and antiparticle subspaces.

product states in (C^d)^{otimes k}, where k and p/d^k are fixed while d grows.
When k=1, the Marcenko-Pastur law determines (up to small corrections) not only
the largest eigenvalue ((1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2) but the smallest eigenvalue
(min(0,1-sqrt{p/d^k})^2) and the spectral density in between. We use the method
of moments to show that for k>1 the largest eigenvalue is still approximately
(1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2 and the spectral density approaches that of the
Marcenko-Pastur law, generalizing the random matrix theory result to the random

sampling from a particular heavy-tailed distribution and for a recently

thus it is worthwhile to consider a specific simple problem in order to

measurement-based quantum computation, where the processing of quantum

species in enzyme-catalysed reactions. This study is stimulated by claims that
the observed magnitude and temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects
imply that quantum tunneling below the energy barrier associated with the
transition state significantly enhances the reaction rate in many enzymes. We
use a path integral approach which provides a general framework to understand
tunneling in a quantum system which interacts with an environment at non-zero
temperature. Here the quantum system is the active site of the enzyme and the
environment is the surrounding protein and water. Tunneling well below the
barrier only occurs for temperatures less than a temperature $T_0$ which is
determined by the curvature of potential energy surface near the top of the
barrier. We argue that for most enzymes this temperature is less than room
temperature. For physically reasonable parameters quantum transition state
theory gives a quantitative description of the temperature dependence and
magnitude of kinetic isotope effects for two classes of enzymes which have been
claimed to exhibit signatures of quantum tunneling. The only quantum effects
are those associated with the transition state, both reflection at the barrier
top and tunneling just below the barrier. We establish that the friction due to
the environment is weak and only slightly modifies the reaction rate.
Furthermore, at room temperature and for typical energy barriers environmental
degrees of freedom with frequencies much less than 1000 cm$^{-1}$ do not have a
significant effect on quantum corrections to the reaction rate.

  localization by external noise","Akiyuki Ishikawa|Atushi Tanaka|Akira Shudo","  Quantum tunneling in the presence of chaos is analyzed, focusing especially
on the interplay between quantum tunneling and dynamical localization. We
observed flooding of potentially existing tunneling amplitude by adding noise
to the chaotic sea to attenuate the destructive interference generating
dynamical localization. This phenomenon is related to the nature of complex
orbits describing tunneling between torus and chaotic regions. The tunneling
rate is found to obey a perturbative scaling with noise intensity when the
noise intensity is sufficiently small and then saturate in a large noise
intensity regime. A relation between the tunneling rate and the localization
length of the chaotic states is also demonstrated. It is shown that due to the
competition between dynamical tunneling and dynamical localization, the
tunneling rate is not a monotonically increasing function of Planck's constant.
The above results are obtained for a system with a sharp border between torus
and chaotic regions. The validity of the results for a system with a smoothed

single quantum systems. In the present contribution a simple but effective
theoretical framework is introduced to clarify the connections between a purely
mechanical description and the thermodynamic characterization of the
equilibrium state of an isolated quantum system. A salient feature of our
approach is the very transparent distinction between the statistical aspects
and the dynamical aspects in the description of isolated quantum systems. Like
in the classical statistical mechanics, the equilibrium distribution of any
property is identified on the basis of the time evolution of the considered
system. As a consequence equilibrium properties of quantum system appear to
depend on the details of the initial state due to the abundance of constants of
the motion in the Schr\""odinger dynamics. On the other hand the study of the
probability distributions of some functions, such as the entropy or the
equilibrium state of a subsystem, in statistical ensembles of pure states

two different statistics introduced in Part I. In order to analyze their
consistency with thermodynamics, these quantities of interest are evaluated in
the limit of large number of components of the isolated system. The main
results can be summarized as follows: typical values of the entropy and of the
equilibrium reduced density matrix as functions of the internal energy in the
fixed expectation energy ensemble do not satisfy the requirement of
thermodynamics. On the contrary, the thermodynamical description is recovered
from the random pure state ensemble (RPSE), provided that one considers systems
large enough. The thermodynamic limit of the considered properties for the spin
system reveals a number of important features. First canonical statistics (and
thus, canonical typicality as long as the fluctuations around the average value
are small) emerges without the need of assuming the microcanonical space for
the global pure state. Moreover, we rigorously prove (i) the equivalence of the
""global temperature,"" derived from the entropy equation of state, with the
""local temperature"" determining the canonical state of the subsystems; and (ii)
the equivalence between the RPSE typical entropy and the canonical entropy for
the overall system.

observables share an orthogonal structure, whose non-uniqueness is found to be
intrinsic to the multi-partite separability and leads to the non-transitivity

This device consists of two modes propagating into two waveguides, each of them

enough to allow exchanging energy between them via evanescent waves. Each mode
interacts with the atom in the same waveguide in the standard way, i.e. as the
Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), and with the atom-mode in the second waveguide via
evanescent wave. We present the Hamiltonian for the system and deduce the exact
form for the wavefunction. We investigate the atomic inversions and the
second-order correlation function. In contrast to the conventional linear
coupler, the atomic quantum coupler is able to generate nonclassical effects.
The atomic inversions can exhibit long revival-collapse phenomenon as well as
subsidiary revivals based on the competition among the switching mechanisms in
the system. Finally, under certain conditions, the system can yield the results
of the two-mode JCM.

that quantum communication over an isotropic medium, as opposed to classical

receiver. Furthermore, for large classes of media there is a threshold, in the
sense that `sufficiently much' of the signal has to be collected. Therefore,
the medium's capacity for quantum communication can be characterized in terms
of how the size of the transmitter and receiver has to scale with the

demonstrate the applicability of this concept, an n-dimensional spin lattice is
considered, yielding a sufficient scaling of d^(n/3) with the distance d.

  Gas","B. Sun|F. Robicheaux","  Spectral line width broadening in Rydberg gases, a phenomenon previously
attributed to the many-body effect, was observed experimentally almost a decade
ago. The observed line width was typically 80-100 times larger than the average
interaction strength predicted from a binary interaction. The interpretation of
such a phenomenon is usually based on the so-called diffusion model, where the
line width broadening mostly originates from the diffusion of excitations. In
this paper, we present a model calculation to show that diffusion is not the
main mechanism to the line width broadening. We find that the rare pair
fluctuation at small separation is the dominant factor contributing to this
broadening. Our results give a width of about 20-30 times larger than the
average interaction strength. More importantly, by turning off the diffusion
process, we do not observe order of magnitude change in the spectral line
width.

presence of external electromagnetic fields, electron asymptotic states are no
longer plane-waves, and hence the propagator in the basis of momentum
eigenstates has a more intricate form. Nevertheless, in the basis of the

harvesting complexes features speedups analogous to those found in quantum
algorithms. Here we compare the dynamics in these light harvesting systems to
the dynamics of quantum walks, in order to elucidate the limits of such quantum
speedups. For the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex of green sulfur bacteria,
we show that while there is indeed speedup at short times, this is short lived
(70 fs) despite longer lived (ps) quantum coherence. Remarkably, this time
scale is independent of the details of the decoherence model. More generally,
we show that the distinguishing features of light-harvesting complexes not only
limit the extent of quantum speedup but also reduce rates of diffusive
transport. These results suggest that quantum coherent effects in biological
systems are optimized for efficiency or robustness rather than the more elusive
goal of quantum speedup.

recovery. The methods are both considerably simpler and more general than
previous approaches. It is shown that an unknown (n x n) matrix of rank r can
be efficiently reconstructed from only O(n r nu log^2 n) randomly sampled
expansion coefficients with respect to any given matrix basis. The number nu
quantifies the ""degree of incoherence"" between the unknown matrix and the

where one aims to recover a low-rank matrix from randomly selected matrix
elements. Our result covers this situation as a special case. The proof
consists of a series of relatively elementary steps, which stands in contrast
to the highly involved methods previously employed to obtain comparable
results. In cases where bounds had been known before, our estimates are
slightly tighter. We discuss operator bases which are incoherent to all
low-rank matrices simultaneously. For these bases, we show that O(n r nu log n)
randomly sampled expansion coefficients suffice to recover any low-rank matrix
with high probability. The latter bound is tight up to multiplicative

  Control of Electronic Excitation Transfer","Jason D. Biggs|Jeffrey A. Cina","  We investigate the control of electronic energy transfer in molecular dimers
through the preparation of specific vibrational coherences prior to electronic
excitation, and its observation by nonlinear wave-packet interferometry.
Laser-driven coherent nuclear motion can affect the instantaneous resonance
between site-excited electronic states and thereby influence short-time
electronic excitation transfer (EET). We first illustrate this control
mechanism with calculations on a dimer whose constituent monomers undergo
harmonic vibrations. We then consider the use of nonlinear wave-packet
interferometry (nl-WPI) experiments to monitor the nuclear dynamics
accompanying EET in general dimer complexes following impulsive vibrational
excitation by a sub-resonant control pulse (or control pulse sequence). In
measurements of this kind, two pairs of polarized phase-related femtosecond
pulses following the control pulse generate superpositions of coherent nuclear
wave packets in optically accessible electronic states. Interference
contributions to the time- and frequency-integrated fluorescence signal due to
overlaps among the superposed wave packets provide amplitude-level information
on the nuclear and electronic dynamics. We derive the basic expression for a
control-pulse-dependent nl-WPI signal. The electronic transition moments of the
constituent monomers are assumed to have a fixed relative orientation, while
the overall orientation of the complex is distributed isotropically. We include
the limiting case of coincident arrival by pulses within each phase-related
pair in which control-influenced nl-WPI reduces to a fluorescence-detected
pump-probe difference experiment. Numerical calculations of pump-probe signals

course of short-time electronic excitation transfer (EET) in molecular dimers
and observing the process by nonlinear wave-packet interferometry (nl-WPI).
Within a sample of isotropically oriented dimers having a specified internal
geometry, a vibrational mode internal to the acceptor chromophore can be
preferentially driven by electronically nonresonant impulsive stimulated Raman
(or resonant infrared) excitation with a short polarized control pulse. A
subsequent electronically resonant polarized pump then preferentially excites
the donor, and EET ensues. Here we test both the control strategy and its
spectroscopic investigation-with some sacrifice of amplitude-level detail-by
calculating the pump-probe difference signal. That signal is the limiting case
of the control-influenced nl-WPI signal in which the two pulses in the pump
pulse-pair coincide, as do the two pulses in the probe pulse-pair. We present
calculated pump-probe difference signals for (1) a model excitation-transfer
complex in which two equal-energy monomers each support one moderately
Franck-Condon active intramolecular vibration; (2) a simplified model of the
covalent dimer dithia-anthracenophane, representing its EET dynamics following
selective impulsive excitation of the weakly Franck-Condon active anthracene
vibration at 385 cm-1; and (3) a model complex featuring moderate
electronic-vibrational coupling in which the site energy of the acceptor
chromophore is lower than that of the donor.

the advanced information and a possible result of computing the missing
information. We gave a theoretical justification of this 50% advanced
information rule and checked that it holds for a large variety of quantum
algorithms. Now we discuss the theoretical justification in further detail and
counter a possible objection. We show that the rule is the generalization of a
simple, well known, explanation of quantum nonlocality - where logical
correlation between measurement outcomes is physically backed by a
causal/deterministic/local process with causality allowed to go backward in
time with backdated state vector reduction. The possible objection is that
quantum algorithms often produce the solution of the problem in an apparently
deterministic way (when their unitary part produces an eigenstate of the
observable to be measured and measurement produces the corresponding eigenvalue
- the solution - with probability 1), while the present explanation of the
speed up relies on the nondeterministic character of quantum measurement. We
show that this objection would mistake the nondeterministic production of a
definite outcome for a deterministic production.

perspective on No-Cloning. What we shall find, quite unexpectedly, is a link to
some fundamental issues in logic, computation, and the foundations of
mathematics. A striking feature of our results is that they are visibly in the
same genre as a well-known result by Joyal in categorical logic showing that a
`Boolean cartesian closed category' trivializes, which provides a major
road-block to the computational interpretation of classical logic. In fact,
they strengthen Joyal's result, insofar as the assumption of a full categorical
product (both diagonals and projections) in the presence of a classical duality
is weakened. This shows a heretofore unsuspected connection between limitative
results in proof theory and No-Go theorems in quantum mechanics.

must specify the precise form of the relevant measurement and symmetry
transformation operators. These operators are determined by a set of rules, the
correspondence rules of quantum theory. The physical origin of these rules is
obscure, and their physical interpretation and their degree of generality is
presently unclear. In this paper, we show that all of the commonly-used
correspondence rules can be systematically derived from a new physical
principle, the Average-Value Correspondence Principle. This principle shows
that the correspondence rules result from the systematic translation of
relations between measurement results known to hold in a classical model of a
system, providing these rules with a clear physical interpretation, and clearly
demarcating their domain of applicability.

"8931","Entanglement entropy and the complex plane of replicas","F. Gliozzi|L. Tagliacozzo","  The entanglement entropy of a subsystem $A$ of a quantum system is expressed,
in the replica method, through analytic continuation with respect to n of the
trace of the n-th power of the reduced density matrix $\tr\rho_A^n$. We study
the analytic properties of this quantity as a function of n in some quantum
critical Ising-like models in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions. Although we find no true
singularities for n>0, there is a threshold value of n close to 2 which
separates two very different `phases'. The region with larger n is
characterized by rapidly convergent Taylor expansions and is very smooth. The
region with smaller n has a very rich and varied structure in the complex n
plane and is characterized by Taylor coefficients which instead of being
monotone decreasing, have a maximum growing with the size of the subsystem.
Finite truncations of the Taylor expansion in this region lead to increasingly
poor approximations of $\tr\rho_A^n$. The computation of the entanglement
entropy from the knowledge of $\tr\rho^n_A$ for positive integer n becomes
extremely difficult particularly in spatial dimensions larger than one, where
one cannot use conformal field theory as a guidance in the extrapolations to
n=1.

"9031","On the influence of resonance photon scattering on atom interference","M. Bozic|D. Arsenovic|A. S. Sanz|M. Davidovic","  Here, the influence of resonance photon-atom scattering on the atom
interference pattern at the exit of a three-grating Mach-Zehnder interferometer
is studied. It is assumed that the scattering process does not destroy the
atomic wave function describing the state of the atom before the scattering
process takes place, but only induces a certain shift and change of its phase.
We find that the visibility of the interference strongly depends on the
statistical distribution of transferred momenta to the atom during the
photon-atom scattering event. This also explains the experimentally observed
(Chapman et al 1995 Phys. Rev. Lett. 75 2783) dependence of the visibility on
the ratio d_p/\lambda_i = y'_{12} (2\pi/kd\lambda_i), where y'_{12} is distance
between the place where the scattering event occurs and the first grating, k is
the wave number of the atomic center-of-mass motion, $d$ is the grating
constant and \lambda_i is the photon wavelength. Furthermore, it is remarkable
that photon-atom scattering events happen experimentally within the Fresnel
region, i.e. the near field region, associated with the first grating, which
should be taken into account when drawing conclusions about the relevance of
""which-way"" information for the interference visibility.

We propose that phonon blockade can serve as a signature of quantum behavior in

cannot be excited when there is one phonon in the nonlinear oscillator. To
realize phonon blockade, a superconducting quantum two-level system is coupled
to the nanomechanical resonator and is used to induce the phonon
self-interaction. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the dynamics of the induced
nonlinear oscillator is studied via the Cahill-Glauber $s$-parametrized
quasiprobability distributions. We show how the oscillation of the resonator

cryptography is that whenever a spy tries to eavesdrop the communication he
causes disturbances in the transmission of the message. Ultimately this
unavoidable disturbance is a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
that limits the joint knowledge of complementary observables. Now, a problem
remains: in order to initialize quantum key distribution, Alice and Bob need to
share a short shared key in order to be able to identify each other
unambiguously. Therefore a trusted courier is needed. We propose in this paper
a solution to the trusted courrier problem that was inspired by quantum
cryptography. The idea is to encode the key that Alice sends to Bob into
unstable nuclei in such a way that the message gets revealed only after the
courrier has delivered it to Bob. In this approach, we replace Heisenberg
uncertainties by another type of uncertainty, that characterizes the knowledge
of the time at which an unstable nucleus decays. As we shall show, this scheme
makes it possible to refresh a key even in the case that we do not trust the

adiabatic computation utilizes adiabatic passage along the quasienergies of
parameter-dependent unitary operators. For example, such computation can be
realized by a concatenation of parameterized quantum circuits, with an
adiabatic though inevitably discrete change of the parameter. A design
principle of adiabatic passage along quasienergy is recently proposed: Cheon's
quasienergy and eigenspace anholonomies on unitary operators is available to
realize anholonomic adiabatic algorithms [Tanaka and Miyamoto, Phys. Rev. Lett.
98, 160407 (2007)], which compose a nontrivial family of discrete adiabatic
algorithms. It is straightforward to port a standard adiabatic algorithm to an
anholonomic adiabatic one, except an introduction of a parameter |v>, which is
available to adjust the gaps of the quasienergies to control the running time
steps. In Grover's database search problem, the costs to prepare |v> for the

two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entanglement, namely the
GHZ-class and the W-class. Any two states within the same class can be
transformed into each other with stochastic local operations and classical
communication (SLOCC) with a non-zero probability. The optimal conversion
probability, however, is only known for special cases. Here, we derive new
lower and upper bounds for the optimal probability of transformation from a
GHZ-state to other states of the GHZ-class. A key idea in the derivation of the
upper bounds is to consider the action of the LOCC protocol on a different
input state, namely $1/\sqrt{2} [\ket{000} - \ket{111}]$, and demand that the
probability of an outcome remains bounded by 1. We also find an upper bound for
more general cases by using the constraints of the so-called interference term
and 3-tangle. Moreover, we generalize some of our results to the case where
each party holds a higher-dimensional system. In particular, we found that the
GHZ state generalized to three qutrits, i.e., $\ket{\mathrm{GHZ}_3} =

phase sensitivities close to the Heisenberg limit when the average photon
number of the squeezed vacuum is close to the average photon number of the
coherent light. Here, we investigate the phase sensitivity of such states in
the presence of photon losses. It is shown that the Cramer-Rao bound of phase
sensitivity can be achieved experimentally by using a weak local oscillator and
photon counting in the output. The phase sensitivity is then given by the
Fisher information F of the state. In the limit of high squeezing, the ratio
(F-N)/N^2 of Fisher information above shot noise to the square of the average
photon number N depends only on the average number of photons lost, n_loss, and
the fraction of squeezed vacuum photons mu. For mu=1/2, the effect of losses is
given by (F-N)/N^2=1/(1+2 n_loss). The possibility of increasing the robustness
against losses by lowering the squeezing fraction mu is considered and an
optimized result is derived. However, the improvements are rather small, with a
maximal improvement by a factor of two at high losses.

be computationally intractable. This is the problem of detecting when a quantum
channel implemented as a circuit is close to a linear isometry, and it is shown
to be complete for the complexity class QMA of verifiable quantum computation.
This is done by relating the problem of detecting when a channel is close to an
isometry to the problem of determining how mixed the output of the channel can
be when the input is a pure state. How mixed the output of the channel is can
be detected by a protocol making use of the swap test: this follows from the
fact that an isometry applied twice in parallel does not affect the symmetry of
the input state under the swap operation.

hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials, which are quantifiers of their
distribution all over the orthogonality interval, are defined and investigated.
These information-theoretic measures of the associated Rakhmanov probability
density, which are direct measures of the polynomial spreading in the sense of
having the same units as the variable, share interesting properties: invariance
under translations and reflections, linear scaling and vanishing in the limit
that the variable tends towards a given definite value. The expressions of the
Renyi and Fisher lengths for the Hermite polynomials are computed in terms of
the polynomial degree. The combinatorial multivariable Bell polynomials, which
are shown to characterize the finite power of an arbitrary polynomial, play a
relevant role for the computation of these information-theoretic lengths.
Indeed these polynomials allow us to design an error-free computing approach
for the entropic moments (weighted L^q-norms) of Hermite polynomials and
subsequently for the Renyi and Tsallis entropies, as well as for the Renyi
spreading lengths. Sharp bounds for the Shannon length of these polynomials are
also given by means of an information-theoretic-based optimization procedure.
Moreover, it is computationally proved the existence of a linear correlation
between the Shannon length (as well as the second-order Renyi length) and the
standard deviation. Finally, the application to the most popular
quantum-mechanical prototype system, the harmonic oscillator, is discussed and
some relevant asymptotical open issues related to the entropic moments
mentioned previously are posed.

reversible discrete-time dynamics, it is intuitive that as much ""quantum
information"" as moves into any given block of cells from the left, has to exit
that block to the right. For two types of such systems - namely quantum walks
and cellular automata - we make this intuition precise by defining an index, a
quantity that measures the ""net flow of quantum information"" through the
system. The index supplies a complete characterization of two properties of the
discrete dynamics. First, two systems S_1, S_2 can be pieced together, in the
sense that there is a system S which locally acts like S_1 in one region and
like S_2 in some other region, if and only if S_1 and S_2 have the same index.
Second, the index labels connected components of such systems: equality of the
index is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a continuous deformation
of S_1 into S_2. In the case of quantum walks, the index is integer-valued,
whereas for cellular automata, it takes values in the group of positive
rationals. In both cases, the map S -> ind S is a group homomorphism if
composition of the discrete dynamics is taken as the group law of the quantum
systems. Systems with trivial index are precisely those which can be realized
by partitioned unitaries, and the prototypes of systems with non-trivial index
are shifts.

interpretation are: (T1), linearity; (T2), invariance under certain groups; and
(T3) the orthogonality and isolation of the different branches of the state
vector. These three imply the particle-like properties of mass, energy,
momentum, spin, charge, and locality are actually properties of the state
vector; and this in turn implies there is no evidence for the existence of
particles. Experimentally there is no evidence for collapse (E1) and
theoretically linearity prohibits collapse. One also has the experimentally
verified probability law (E2), which is found to rule out the many-worlds
interpretation. The failure of these three major interpretation, particles,
collapse, and many-worlds, apparently implies an acceptable interpretation must
be based on perception. Rather than being a separate principle, probability
follows in this interpretation from a weak assumption on perception plus the
combinatorics when an experiment is run many times. This suggests a relatively
simple experimental test of the perception interpretation.

violation of a Bell inequality, whose success depends both on the state of the

given the state, optimized parameters for a successful test. Here we provide,
for a quite general class of quantum states, the explicit expressions of these

the corresponding suitable experimental settings may unexpectedly vary

Chen and Leipnik-Newton. The rotational, volume preserving part of the flow
preserves in time a family of two intersecting surfaces, the so called {\em
Nambu Hamiltonians}. They foliate the entire phase space and are, in turn,
deformed in time by Dissipation which represents their irrotational part of the
flow. It is given by the gradient of a scalar function and is responsible for
the emergence of the Strange Attractors.
  Based on our recent work on Quantum Nambu Mechanics, we provide an explicit
quantization of the Lorenz attractor through the introduction of
Non-commutative phase space coordinates as Hermitian $ N \times N $ matrices in
$ R^{3}$. They satisfy the commutation relations induced by one of the two
Nambu Hamiltonians, the second one generating a unique time evolution.
Dissipation is incorporated quantum mechanically in a self-consistent way
having the correct classical limit without the introduction of external degrees
of freedom. Due to its volume phase space contraction it violates the quantum
commutation relations. We demonstrate that the Heisenberg-Nambu evolution
equations for the Quantum Lorenz system give rise to an attracting ellipsoid in

captured, and provide mathematical tools such as final coalgebras, bisimulation
and coalgebraic logic. However, the standard coalgebraic framework does not
accommodate contravariance, and is too rigid to allow physical symmetries to be

contravariance is represented by indexing. We use this structure to give a
universal semantics for quantum systems based on a final coalgebra

equivalence. We also define an analogous indexed structure for Chu spaces, and
use this to obtain a novel categorical description of the category of Chu
spaces. We use the indexed structures of Chu spaces and coalgebras over a
common base to define a truncation functor from coalgebras to Chu spaces. This
truncation functor is used to lift the full and faithful representation of the
groupoid of physical symmetries on Hilbert spaces into Chu spaces, obtained in

symmetry-breaking (as opposed to the particle number conserving) formalism, and
include configurations with all values of angular momenta in the partition
function. At finite temperature, there appear sphaleron configurations
associated to isolated vortices. The contribution from these configurations to
the free energy is computed in the dilute gas approximation. We show that the
Euclidean action of linearized perturbations of a vortex is not positive
definite. As a consequence the free energy of the 2D Bose gas acquires an
imaginary part. This signals the instability of the gas. This instability may
be identified with the Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless (BKT) transition.

system and environment, both of which are common physical situations following
excitation of the system away from thermal equilibrium. Although the approach
is not universal, in cases where it is valid it returns a complete set of
positive maps for the dynamical evolution of a quantum system at all times.

"8234","Identical Particles in Quantum Mechanics","Andrea Lubberdink","  If, in a system of identical particles, the one particle state is defined by
the partial trace to one of the component spaces of the total Hilbert space,
then all one particle states are identical. The particles are
indistinguishable. This is often thought to be a typical quantum mechanical
phenomenon. I will show however that an analogous procedure to define particle
states exists in classical mechanics, which results in classical
indistinguishable identical particles. From this analogy it follows that the
indistinguishability of identical particles depends on how we define particle
states. It is not an inevitable result of the symmetry postulate.
  Indeed, if particles are defined by partial traces, consistent use of the
symmetry postulate leads to the conclusion that all identical particles in the
universe are indistinguishable, so that particles can never be pointed at, not
even in the classical limit. This does not correspond to the way the term
particle is actually used in practice. I will argue that a particle should be
defined in such a way that in the classical limit the quantum particle state
becomes the state of a classical particle. This will lead us to a definition of
particles which is in line with the way the term particle is actually used by
physicists.

complexity of optimizing quantum mechanical control systems. The study is based
on a topology analysis of the corresponding quantum control landscape, which is
referred to as the optimization objective as a functional of control fields. We
find that the degree of controllability is closely relevant with the ruggedness
of the landscape, which determines the search efficiency for global optima.
This effect is demonstrated via the gate fidelity control landscape of a system
whose controllability is restricted on a SU(2) dynamic symmetry group. We show
that multiple local false traps (i.e., non-global suboptima) exist even if the
target gate is realizable and that the number of these traps is increased by
the loss of controllability, while the controllable systems are always devoid
of false traps.

  First, we show that there exists an oracle relation problem (i.e., a problem

yields a non-oracle relation problem that is solvable in quantum logarithmic

follow from the Generalized Linial-Nisan Conjecture, which we formulate here

walks, SQW$^{(d)}, d=1,2$, show a striking contrast to the classical
counterparts, the simple random walks, SRW$^{(d)}$. The limit distributions
have novel structures such that they are inverted-bell shaped and the supports
of them are bounded. In the present paper we claim that these properties of the
SQW$^{(d)}$ can be explained by the theory of relativistic quantum mechanics.
We show that the Dirac equation with a proper ultraviolet cutoff can provide a
quantum walk model in three dimensions, where the walker has a four-component
qubit. We clarify that the pseudovelocity $\V(t)$ of the quantum walker, which
solves the Dirac equation, is identified with the relativistic velocity. Since
the quantum walker should be a tardyon, not a tachyon, $|\V(t)| < c$, where $c$
is the speed of light, and this restriction (the causality) is the origin of
the finiteness of supports of the limit distributions universally found in
quantum walk models. By reducing the number of components of momentum in the
Dirac equation, we obtain the limit distributions of pseudovelocities for the
lower dimensional quantum walks. We show that the obtained limit distributions
for the one- and two-dimensional systems have the common features with those of
SQW$^{(1)}$ and SQW$^{(2)}$.

example of this phenomenon is the measurement process, in which the wave
function of the laboratory (quantum system + apparatus + environment)
decomposes into n parts, corresponding to the n outcomes of the measurement:
the parts are non-overlapping, because they represent a macroscopic pointer in
different positions, and they are permanently non-overlapping due to the
irreversible interaction with the environment. PSD is often mentioned in the
literature, but until now no formal definition or systematic study of this
phenomenon has been undertaken. The aim of this paper is to partially fill this

which provably finds a good approximation of the ground state of 1D systems
under well defined conditions. More precisely, our algorithm finds a Matrix
Product State of bond dimension $D$ whose energy approximates the minimal
energy such states can achieve. The running time is exponential in D, and so
the algorithm can be considered tractable even for D which is logarithmic in
the size of the chain. The result also implies trivially that the ground state
of any local commuting Hamiltonian in 1D can be approximated efficiently; we
improve this to an exact algorithm.

the classical deterministic Newtonian world. We argue that in fact the Newton
determinism in classical world does not hold and in classical mechanics there
is fundamental and irreducible randomness. The classical Newtonian trajectory
does not have a direct physical meaning since arbitrary real numbers are not
observable. There are classical uncertainty relations, i.e. the uncertainty
(errors of observation) in the determination of coordinate and momentum is
always positive (non zero).
  A ""functional"" formulation of classical mechanics was suggested. The
fundamental equation of the microscopic dynamics in the functional approach is
not the Newton equation but the Liouville equation for the distribution
function of the single particle. Solutions of the Liouville equation have the
property of delocalization which accounts for irreversibility. The Newton
equation in this approach appears as an approximate equation describing the
dynamics of the average values of the position and momenta for not too long
time intervals. Corrections to the Newton trajectories are computed. An
interpretation of quantum mechanics is attempted in which both classical and
quantum mechanics contain fundamental randomness. Instead of an ensemble of
events one introduces an ensemble of observers.

computation theory (t-QCT), where the computation time is defined by the
physical one and the Hamiltonian contains only one- and two-qubit interactions.
This version of t-QCT is also considered as optimality by sub-Riemannian
geodesic length. The work has two aims: one is to develop a t-QCT itself based
on physically natural concept of time, and the other is to pursue the
possibility of using t-QCT as a tool to estimate the complexity in conventional
gate-optimal quantum computation theory (g-QCT). In particular, we investigate
to what extent is true the statement: time complexity is polynomial in the
number of qubits if and only if so is gate complexity. In the analysis, we
relate t-QCT and optimal control theory (OCT) through fidelity-optimal
computation theory (f-QCT); f-QCT is equivalent to t-QCT in the limit of unit
optimal fidelity, while it is formally similar to OCT. We then develop an
efficient numerical scheme for f-QCT by modifying Krotov's method in OCT, which
has monotonic convergence property. We implemented the scheme and obtained
solutions of f-QCT and of t-QCT for the quantum Fourier transform and a unitary
operator that does not have an apparent symmetry. The former has a polynomial
gate complexity and the latter is expected to have exponential one because a
series of generic unitary operators has a exponential gate complexity. The time
complexity for the former is found to be linear in the number of qubits, which
is understood naturally by the existence of an upper bound. The time complexity
for the latter is exponential. Thus the both targets are examples satisfyng the
statement above. The typical characteristics of the optimal Hamiltonians are
symmetry under time-reversal and constancy of one-qubit operation, which are
mathematically shown to hold in fairly general situations.

that ""in comparison with the adiabatic geometric gates, the nontrivial cyclic
loop is unnecessary, and thus the errors in obtaining the required solid angle
are avoided, which makes this new kind of phase gates superior to the geometric
gates."" In this Comment, we point out that geometric operations, including
adiabatic holonomies, can be induced by noncyclic Hamiltonians, and show that
Zheng's gate is geometric. We also argue that the nontrivial loop responsible

the initial states and the channel parameters like the temperature and the
ratio $r$ between $\omega_0$ the characteristic frequency of the quantum system
of interest, and $\omega_c$ the cut-off frequency of Ohmic reservoir. We give a
stationary analysis of the concurrence and find that the dynamic of
non-markovian entanglement concurrence $\mathcal{C}_{\rho}(t)$ at temperature
$k_BT=0$ is different from the $k_BT>0$ case. We find that ""entanglement sudden
death"" (ESD) depends on the initial state when $k_BT=0$, otherwise the
concurrence always disappear at finite time when $k_BT>0$, which means that ESD
must happen. The main result of this paper is that the non-Markovian
entanglement dynamic is fundamentally different from the Markovian one. In the
Markovian channel, entanglement decays exponentially and vanishes only
asymptotically, but in the non-Markovian channel the concurrence
$\mathcal{C}_{\rho}(t)$ oscillates, especially in the high temperature case.
Then an open-loop controller adjusted by the temperature is proposed to control
the entanglement and prolong the ESD time.

a knot tied in a rope in 3-space. This quantum system, called a quantum knot
system, is physically implementable in the same sense as Shor's quantum

  To define a quantum knot system, we replace the standard three Reidemeister
knot moves with an equivalent set of three moves, called respectively wiggle,
wag, and tug, so named because they mimic how a dog might wag its tail. We
argue that these moves are in fact more ""physics friendly"" because, unlike the
Reidemeister moves, they respect the differential geometry of 3-space, and
moreover they can be transformed into infinitesimal moves.
  These three moves wiggle, wag, and tug generate a unitary group, called the
lattice ambient group, which acts on the state space of the quantum system. The
lattice ambient group represents all possible ways of moving a rope around in
3-space without cutting the rope, and without letting the rope pass through
itself.
  We then investigate those quantum observables of the quantum knot system

and is used to explicitly calculate the effective field in the one-loop

self-energy can be consistently related to the pole shift, and that the
presence of the heat bath leads to appearance of an effective varepsilon sim T,
thus providing a natural infrared regulator of the theory. We find that the
one-loop effective Coulomb field calculated using this varepsilon vanishes. The
other scheme combines an infrared momentum cutoff with smearing of the
delta-functions in the interaction vertices. We prove that this regularization
admits factorization of the infrared contributions in multi-loop diagrams, and
sum the corresponding infinite series. The effective electromagnetic field is
found to vanish in this case too. An essentially perturbative nature of this

with Y perfect EPR pairs, where Y = NE +- O(\sqrt N). Our protocol is
streaming, so the N input systems are fed in one at a time, and perfect EPR
pairs start popping out almost immediately. It matches the optimal block
protocol exactly at each stage, so the average yield after n inputs is <Y> = nE

lag -- our protocol optimizes both. In contrast, the optimal N-qubit block
protocol achieves the same yield, but since no EPR pairs are produced until the

moment of the particle. It is shown that particles, independently of the value
of the charge, in addition to the known couplings to the geometry also couple
to the mean curvature in the surface when a Neumann type of constraint is
applied on the transverse fluctuations of the wave function. In contrast to a
Dirrichlet constraint on the transverse fluctuations a Neumann type of
constraint on these degrees of freedom will in general make the equations of
motion non separable. The exceptions are the equations of motion for
electrically neutral particles on surfaces with constant mean curvature. In the
presence of electric currents the equation of motion of a charged particle is
generally non separable independently of the coupling to the geometry and the
boundary constraints.

"8533","No Strong Parallel Repetition with Entangled and Non-signaling Provers","Julia Kempe|Oded Regev","  We consider one-round games between a classical verifier and two provers. One
of the main questions in this area is the \emph{parallel repetition question}:
If the game is played $\ell$ times in parallel, does the maximum winning
probability decay exponentially in $\ell$? In the classical setting, this
question was answered in the affirmative by Raz. More recently the question
arose whether the decay is of the form $(1-\Theta(\eps))^\ell$ where $1-\eps$
is the value of the game and $\ell$ is the number of repetitions. This question
is known as the \emph{strong parallel repetition question} and was motivated by
its connections to the unique games conjecture. It was resolved by Raz who
showed that strong parallel repetition does \emph{not} hold, even in the very
special case of games known as XOR games.
  This opens the question whether strong parallel repetition holds in the case
when the provers share entanglement. Evidence for this is provided by the
behavior of XOR games, which have strong (in fact \emph{perfect}) parallel
repetition, and by the recently proved strong parallel repetition of linear
unique games. A similar question was open for games with so-called
non-signaling provers. Here the best known parallel repetition theorem is due
to Holenstein, and is of the form $(1-\Theta(\eps^2))^\ell$.
  We show that strong parallel repetition holds neither with entangled provers
nor with non-signaling provers. In particular we obtain that Holenstein's bound
is tight. Along the way we also provide a tight characterization of the
asymptotic behavior of the entangled value under parallel repetition of unique
games in terms of a semidefinite program.

some features with quantum theory, such as probabilistic predictions for
individual outcomes (indeterminism), the impossibility of information transfer
faster than speed of light (no-signaling) or the impossibility of copying of

principles behind quantum theory either fall short of deriving the theory

that classical probability theory and quantum theory can be reconstructed from
three reasonable axioms: (1) (Information capacity) All systems with
information carrying capacity of one bit are equivalent. (2) (Locality) The
state of a composite system is completely determined by measurements on its
subsystems. (3) (Reversibility) Between any two pure states there exists a
reversible transformation. If one requires the transformation from the last
axiom to be continuous, one separates quantum theory from the classical
probabilistic one. A remarkable result following from our reconstruction is
that no probability theory other than quantum theory can exhibit entanglement

discovered that certain two-qutrit entangled states interacting with
multi-local decoherence undergo distillability sudden death whereas their
locally equivalent states do not exhibit such behavior. We have found that
their basic equation of motion missed some terms and therefore the subsequent
calculations and conclusions are not correct/valid except that distillability
sudden death may occur. We provide the missing terms and point out the
corrections which must be done in the literature to remove confusion. Moreover,
we have studied this feature for certain entangled states under global,
collective and multi-local decoherence. We have found that entanglement sudden
death and distillability sudden death may happen under global and multi-local
noises. Moreover, local unitary transformations can not avoid distillability
sudden death.

  Operating in the Quantum Hall Effect Regime","Nissim Ofek|Aveek Bid|Moty Heiblum|Ady Stern|Vladimir Umansky|Diana Mahalu","  Interference of edge channels is expected to be a prominent tool for studying
statistics of charged quasiparticles in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) [A. Stern
(2008), Ann. Phys. 1:204; C. Chamon et al. (1997), Phys. Rev. B, 55:2331]. We
present here a detailed study of an electronic Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI)
operating in the QHE regime [C. Chamon et al. (1997), Phys. Rev. B, 55:2331],
with the phase of the interfering quasiparticles controlled by the
Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. Our main finding is that Coulomb interactions among
the electrons dominate the interference, even in a relatively large area FPI,
leading to a strong dependence of the area enclosed by the interference loop on
the magnetic field. In particular, for a composite edge structure, with a few
independent edge channels propagating along the edge, interference of the
outmost edge channel (belonging to the lowest Landau level) was insensitive to
magnetic field; suggesting a constant enclosed flux. However, when any of the
inner edge channels interfered, the enclosed flux decreased when the magnetic
field increased. By intentionally varying the enclosed area with a biased
metallic gate and observing the periodicity of the interference pattern,
charges e (for integer filling factors) and e/3 (for a fractional filling
factor) were found to be expelled from the FPI. Moreover, these observations
provided also a novel way of detecting the charge of the interfering
quasiparticles.

computational abilities of quantum systems and the Church-Turing Thesis role in
Physics. We propose here the idea of geometry of effective physical process as
the essentially physical notion of computation. In Quantum mechanics we cannot
use the traditional Euclidean geometry but we introduce more sophisticate non
Euclidean geometry which include a new kind of information diffuse in the
entire universe and that we can represent as Fisher information or active
information. We remark that from the Fisher information we can obtain the Bohm
and Hiley quantum potential and the classical Schrodinger equation. We can see
the quantum phenomena do not affect a limited region of the space but is
reflected in a change of the geometry of all the universe. In conclusion any
local physical change or physical process is reflected in all the universe by
the change of its geometry, This is the deepest meaning of the entanglement in
Quantum mechanics and quantum computing. We stress the connection between
metric and information as measure of change. Because computation is not
restricted to calculus but is the environment changing via physical processes,
super-Turing potentialities derive from an incomputable information source
embedded into the geometry of the universe in accordance with Bell's
constraints. In the general relativity we define the geometry of the space
time. In our approach quantum phenomena define the geometry of the parameters
of the probability distribution that include also the space time parameters. To
study this new approach to the computation we use the new theory of Morphogenic
systems.

considerations: It serves as an upper bound to the attainable quantum Fisher
information for the channel parameters using Gaussian states, under generic
constraints on the physically available resources. Our approach naturally

We prove that optimal probe states are always pure and bounded in the number of

the complexity of optimal experimental setups for channel estimation and
reduces the computational requirements for the evaluation of the metric:
Indeed, we construct a converging algorithm for its computation. We provide

unitary and local Clifford equivalence classes of the stabilizer states are not
always the same. Despite the fact this settles the LU-LC conjecture, a
sufficient condition for stabilizer states that violate the LU-LC conjecture is
missing. In this paper, we investigate further the properties of stabilizer
states with respect to local equivalence. Our first result shows that there
exist infinitely many stabilizer states which violate the LU-LC conjecture. In
particular, we show that for all numbers of qubits $n\geq 28$, there exist
distance two stabilizer states which are counterexamples to the LU-LC
conjecture. We prove that for all odd $n\geq 195$, there exist stabilizer
states with distance greater than two which are LU equivalent but not LC
equivalent. Two important classes of stabilizer states that are of great
interest in quantum computation are the cluster states and stabilizer states of
the surface codes. To date, the status of these states with respect to the
LU-LC conjecture was not studied. We show that, under some minimal
restrictions, both these classes of states preclude any counterexamples. In
this context, we also show that the associated surface codes do not have any
encoded non-Clifford transversal gates. We characterize the CSS surface code
states in terms of a class of minor closed binary matroids. In addition to
making connection with an important open problem in binary matroid theory, this
characterization does in some cases provide an efficient test for CSS states
that are not counterexamples.

contain numerous paradoxes, many scientists doubt their internal consistencies.
However, these paradoxes can be resolved within the framework of the existing

formulas. Exact formulas and explanations are included in the Appendices. The
text is supplemented by illustrations to enhance the understanding of the
paper. The paradoxes underlying thermodynamics and quantum mechanics are also
discussed. The approaches to the solutions of these paradoxes are suggested.
The first approach is dependent on the influence of the external observer
(environment), which disrupts the correlations in the system. The second
approach is based on the limits of the self-knowledge of the system for the
case in which both the external observer and the environment are included in
the considered system. The concepts of observable dynamics, ideal dynamics, and
unpredictable dynamics are introduced. The phenomenon of complex (living)
systems is contemplated from the point of view of these dynamics.

4-dimensional pure LGT with gauge group Z_2 (4D Z_2 LGT). This provides a
unification of models with apparently very different features into a single

any classical spin model and the Hamilton function of a model with all possible

elaborate on the proof of the result, and we illustrate it by computing

mean-field theory of Z_2 LGTs with d > 3, and to show that computing the
partition function of the 4D Z_2 LGT is computationally hard (#P hard). The

  could have told Einstein at Solvay had he known about Bell experiments)","Eric G. Cavalcanti|Howard M. Wiseman","  The 1964 theorem of John Bell shows that no model that reproduces the
predictions of quantum mechanics can simultaneously satisfy the assumptions of
locality and determinism. On the other hand, the assumptions of \emph{signal
locality} plus \emph{predictability} are also sufficient to derive Bell
inequalities. This simple theorem, previously noted but published only
relatively recently by Masanes, Acin and Gisin, has fundamental implications
not entirely appreciated. Firstly, nothing can be concluded about the
ontological assumptions of locality or determinism independently of each other
-- it is possible to reproduce quantum mechanics with deterministic models that
violate locality as well as indeterministic models that satisfy locality. On
the other hand, the operational assumption of signal locality is an empirically
testable (and well-tested) consequence of relativity. Thus Bell inequality
violations imply that we can trust that some events are fundamentally
\emph{unpredictable}, even if we cannot trust that they are indeterministic.
This result grounds the quantum-mechanical prohibition of arbitrarily accurate
predictions on the assumption of no superluminal signalling, regardless of any
postulates of quantum mechanics. It also sheds a new light on an early stage of
the historical debate between Einstein and Bohr.

system of two finite ensembles of coupled harmonic oscillators. After
identification of a collective degree of freedom, the Hamiltonian is mapped
onto a model of Caldeira-Leggett type, where the collective coordinate is
coupled to an internal bath of phonons. In contrast to the usual
Caldeira-Leggett model, the bath in the present case is part of the system. We
derive an equation of motion for the collective coordinate which takes the form
of a damped harmonic oscillator. We show that the distribution of quantum

  Dielectric Media in Thermal Equilibrium","F. S. S. Rosa|D. A. R. Dalvit|P. W. Milonni","  The derivation of Casimir forces between dielectrics can be simplified by
ignoring absorption, calculating energy changes due to displacements of the
dielectrics, and only then admitting absorption by allowing permittivities to
be complex. As a first step towards a better understanding of this situation we
consider in this paper the model of a dielectric as a collection of
oscillators, each of which is coupled to a reservoir giving rise to damping and
Langevin forces on the oscillators and a noise polarization acting as a source
of a fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) field in the dielectric. The model leads
naturally to expressions for the quantized EM fields that are consistent with
those obtained by different approaches, and also results in a
fluctuation-dissipation relation between the noise polarization and the
imaginary part of the permittivity; comparison with the Rytov
fluctuation-dissipation relation employed in the well-known Lifshitz theory for
the van der Waals (or Casimir) force shows that the Lifshitz theory is actually
a classical stochastic electrodynamical theory. The approximate classical
expression for the energy density in a band of frequencies at which absorption
in a dielectric is negligible is shown to be exact as a spectral thermal
equilibrium expectation value in the quantum-electrodynamical theory. Our main
result is the derivation of an expression for the QED energy density of a
uniform dispersive, absorbing media in thermal equilibrium. The spectral
density of the energy is found to have the same form with or without
absorption. We also show how the fluctuation-dissipation theorem ensures a
detailed balance of energy exchange between the (absorbing) medium, the
reservoir and the EM field in thermal equilibrium.

  sources","Marcos Curty|Xiongfeng Ma|Bing Qi|Tobias Moroder","  Decoy states have been proven to be a very useful method for significantly
enhancing the performance of quantum key distribution systems with practical
light sources. While active modulation of the intensity of the laser pulses is
an effective way of preparing decoy states in principle, in practice passive
preparation might be desirable in some scenarios. Typical passive schemes
involve parametric down-conversion. More recently, it has been shown that phase
randomized weak coherent pulses (WCP) can also be used for the same purpose [M.
Curty {\it et al.}, Opt. Lett. {\bf 34}, 3238 (2009).] This proposal requires
only linear optics together with a simple threshold photon detector, which
shows the practical feasibility of the method. Most importantly, the resulting
secret key rate is comparable to the one delivered by an active decoy state
setup with an infinite number of decoy settings. In this paper we extend these
results, now showing specifically the analysis for other practical scenarios
with different light sources and photo-detectors. In particular, we consider
sources emitting thermal states, phase randomized WCP, and strong coherent
light in combination with several types of photo-detectors, like, for instance,
threshold photon detectors, photon number resolving detectors, and classical
photo-detectors. Our analysis includes as well the effect that detection
inefficiencies and noise in the form of dark counts shown by current threshold
detectors might have on the final secret ket rate. Moreover, we provide
estimations on the effects that statistical fluctuations due to a finite data
size can have in practical implementations.

we consider non-equilibrium distributions and their relaxation properties for a
particular class of trajectory theories, first studied in detail by Deotto and
Ghirardi, that are empirically equivalent to the de Broglie-Bohm theory in
quantum equilibrium. For the examples of such theories that we consider, we
find a speed-up of the relaxation compared to the ordinary de Broglie-Bohm

There is no observable which could be associated with the whole ensemble of

the case of a CSMDS, any observable splits into noncommuting observables
associated with the substates. To calculate the average value of any observable

  A new classification of correlations between a system and environment using

symmetric quantity between exchange of systems and this leads to ambiguity in
classifications - states which are both quantum and classically correlated
depending on the order of the two systems.
  State preparation in quantum process tomography is investigated with regard
to non-CP maps. In SQPT the preparation procedure can influence the
complete-positivity of the reconstructed quantum operation if our system is
initially correlated with an environment. We examine a recently proposed
preparation procedures using projective measurements, and propose our own
protocol that uses a single measurement followed by unitary rotations. The
former can give rise to non-CP evolution while the later will always give rise
to a CP map. State preparation in AAPT was found always to give rise to CP
evolution.
  We examine the effect of statistical noise in process tomography and find it
can result in the identification of a non-CP when the evolution should be CP.
The variance of the distribution for reconstructed processes is found to be

physical process. Inaccuracies in the theoretical modelling of such processes
or failures of the devices, possibly due to adversarial attacks, limit the
reliability of random number generators in ways that are difficult to control

of genuine randomness. It is thereby possible to design of a new type of
cryptographically secure random number generator which does not require any

randomness generation is impossible classically and possible in quantum systems
only if certified by a Bell inequality violation. We carry out a

equilibrium and static properties of quantum systems. This requires the
preparation of ground and Gibbs states on a quantum computer. For classical
systems, this problem is solved by the ubiquitous Metropolis algorithm, a
method that basically acquired a monopoly for the simulation of interacting
particles. Here, we demonstrate how to implement a quantum version of the
Metropolis algorithm on a quantum computer. This algorithm permits to sample
directly from the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and thus evades the sign
problem present in classical simulations. A small scale implementation of this

lay-out packages are used to develop a three dimensional (3D) classical

demonstrated for the two structures when the details of the structure are
transferred from the CAD to the model capturing the full 3D topography. Small
uncertainty in device dimensions due to uncontrolled variation in processing,
like layer thickness and gate size, are calculated to be sufficient to explain
the disagreement. The sensitivity of the capacitances to small variations in
the structure also highlights the limits of accuracy of capacitance models for
QD analysis. We furthermore observe that a critical density, the metal
insulator transition, can be used as a good approximation of the metallic edge
of the quantum dot when electron density in the dot is calculated directly with

first, we discuss the task of coin tossing, principally in order to highlight
the effect different physical theories have on security in a straightforward
manner, but, also, to introduce a new protocol for non-relativistic strong coin
tossing. This protocol matches the security of the best protocol known to date
while using a conceptually different approach to achieve the task.
  In the second part variable bias coin tossing is introduced. This is a
variant of coin tossing in which one party secretly chooses one of two biased
coins to toss. It is shown that this can be achieved with unconditional
security for a specified range of biases, and with cheat-evident security for
any bias. We also discuss two further protocols which are conjectured to be
unconditionally secure for any bias.
  The third section looks at other two-party secure computations for which,
prior to our work, protocols and no-go theorems were unknown. We introduce a
general model for such computations, and show that, within this model, a wide
range of functions are impossible to compute securely. We give explicit
cheating attacks for such functions.
  In the final chapter we discuss the task of expanding a private random
string, while dropping the usual assumption that the protocol's user trusts her
devices. Instead we assume that all quantum devices are supplied by an
arbitrarily malicious adversary. We give two protocols that we conjecture
securely perform this task. The first allows a private random string to be

Grothendieck's inequality, a fundamental theorem of analysis, which shows that
two players sharing entanglement can achieve at most a constant factor
advantage over players following classical strategies in an XOR game.
  Perez-Garcia et al. show that when the players share GHZ states, this
advantage is bounded by a constant. We use a multilinear generalization of
Grothendieck's inequality due to Blei and Tonge to simplify the proof of the
second result and extend it to the case of so-called Schmidt states, answering
an open problem of Perez-Garcia et al. Via a reduction given in that paper,
this answers a 35-year-old problem in operator algebras due to Varopoulos,
showing that the space of compact operators on a Hilbert space is a Q-algebra
under Schur product.
  A further generalization of Grothendieck's inequality due to Carne lets us
show that the gap between the entangled and classical value is at most a
constant in any multiplayer XOR game in which the players are allowed to share
combinations of GHZ states and EPR pairs of any dimension.
  As an application of our results, we show that the discrepancy method in
communication complexity remains a lower bound in the multiparty model where
the players have quantum communication and the kinds of entanglement discussed
above. This answers an open question of Lee, Schechtman, and Shraibman.

provides a necessary and sufficient condition to quantify strictly the
non-Markovianity. In the opposite case, when no information whatsoever is

no optimization procedure underlies our derivation, which greatly enhances the

"2536","Quantum Darwinism in non-ideal environments","Michael Zwolak|H. T. Quan|Wojciech H. Zurek","  Quantum Darwinism provides an information-theoretic framework for the
emergence of the objective, classical world from the quantum substrate. The key
to this emergence is the proliferation of redundant information throughout the
environment where observers can then intercept it. We study this process for a
purely decohering interaction when the environment, E, is in a non-ideal (e.g.,
mixed) initial state. In the case of good decoherence, that is, after the
pointer states have been unambiguously selected, the mutual information between
the system, S, and an environment fragment, F, is given solely by F's entropy
increase. This demonstrates that the environment's capacity for recording the
state of S is directly related to its ability to increase its entropy.
Environments that remain nearly invariant under the interaction with S, either
because they have a large initial entropy or a misaligned initial state,
therefore have a diminished ability to acquire information. To elucidate the
concept of good decoherence, we show that - when decoherence is not complete -
the deviation of the mutual information from F's entropy change is quantified
by the quantum discord, i.e., the excess mutual information between S and F is
information regarding the initial coherence between pointer states of S. In
addition to illustrating these results with a single qubit system interacting
with a multi-qubit environment, we find scaling relations for the redundancy of
information acquired by the environment that display a universal behavior
independent of the initial state of S. Our results demonstrate that Quantum
Darwinism is robust with respect to non-ideal initial states of the
environment: the environment almost always acquires redundant information about
the system but its rate of acquisition can be reduced.

efficient numerical algorithms for finding the optimal design, and analytic

Analytic solutions using the two-state model are obtained and found to be

the importance of the noise power at low frequency. If it vanishes there is, in

two apparently similar noise signals, but differing in the power at zero

on the impossibility of faster-than-light signaling; however, their protocol is
inefficient and cannot tolerate any noise. While their key-distribution scheme

superluminal signaling, rather than the correctness and completeness of quantum

introduce a new protocol which is efficient in terms of both classical and

prove that it offers device-independent security under the sole assumption that
certain non-signaling conditions are satisfied. Our main insight is that the
XOR of a number of bits that are partially secret according to the
non-signaling conditions turns out to be highly secret. Note that similar
statements have been well-known in classical contexts. Earlier results had
indicated that amplification of such non-signaling-based privacy is impossible

eliminates all paths except for two that represent continuously forwards and

work may provide fresh insight into the long-standing problem of modeling the

length, with a slightly smaller output length $\Theta((K-b)/K^\gamma)$ for any
$\gamma>0$. In contrast, the previous best construction \cite{TS09} could only
extract $(K/b)^{1/15}$ bits. Some of our constructions have the additional
advantage that every bit of the output is a function of only a polylogarithmic
number of bits from the source, which is crucial for some cryptographic
applications.
  Our argument is based on bounds for a generalization of quantum random access
codes, which we call \emph{quantum functional access codes}. This is crucial as
it lets us avoid the local list-decoding algorithm central to the approach in
\cite{TS09}, which was the source of the multiplicative overhead.

"5238","Impossibility of large phase shifts via the ""giant Kerr effect"" with
  single-photon wavepackets","Julio Gea-Banacloche","  An approximate analytical solution is presented, along with numerical
calculations, for a system of two single-photon wavepackets interacting via an
ideal, localized Kerr medium. It is shown that, because of spontaneous emission
into the initially unoccupied temporal modes, the cross-phase modulation in the
Schrodinger picture is very small as long as the spectral width of the
single-photon pulses is well within the medium's bandwidth. In this limit, the
Hamiltonian used can be derived from the ""giant Kerr effect"" for a four-level
atom, under conditions of electromagnetically-induced transparency; it is shown
explicitly that the linear absorption in this system increases as the pulse's
spectral width approaches the medium's transparency bandwidth, and hence, as
long as the absorption probability remains small, the maximum cross-phase
modulation is limited to essentially useless values. These results are in
agreement with the general, causality- and unitarity-based arguments of Shapiro
and co-workers.

is one of the central problems in quantum mechanics, and in this respect, the
local density of states (LDOS) provides an in- depth description of such a
response. The LDOS is the distribution of the overlaps squared connecting the
set of eigenfunctions with the perturbed one. Here, we show that in the case of
closed systems with classically chaotic dynamics, the LDOS is a Breit-Wigner
distribution under very general perturbations of arbitrary high intensity.
Consequently, we derive a semiclassical expression for the width of the LDOS
which is shown to be very accurate for paradigmatic systems of quantum chaos.
This Letter demonstrates the universal response of quantum systems with
classically chaotic dynamics.

sampling from the quantum Fourier spectrum is used to discover periodicity of
the modular exponentiation function. In a generalization of this idea, quantum
Fourier sampling can be used to discover hidden subgroup structures of some
functions much more efficiently than it is possible classically. Another
problem for which the Fourier transform has been recruited successfully on a
quantum computer is the hidden shift problem. Quantum algorithms for hidden
shift problems usually have a slightly different flavor from hidden subgroup
algorithms, as they use the Fourier transform to perform a correlation with a
given reference function, instead of sampling from the Fourier spectrum
directly. In this paper we show that hidden shifts can be extracted efficiently
from Boolean functions that are quadratic forms. We also show how to identify
an unknown quadratic form on n variables using a linear number of queries, in
contrast to the classical case were this takes Theta(n^2) many queries to a
black box. What is more, we show that our quantum algorithm is robust in the
sense that it can also infer the shift if the function is close to a quadratic,

specifically consider the situation where the evolution of the optical field is
governed by the quantum nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE). Although this
kind of nonlinearity is quite general, we focus on a realistic implementation
involving cold atoms loaded in a hollow-core optical fiber, where the atomic
system provides a tunable nonlinearity that can be large even at a
single-photon level. In particular, we show that when the interaction between
photons is effectively repulsive, the transmission of multi-photon components
of the field is suppressed. This leads to anti-bunching of the transmitted
light and indicates that the system acts as a single-photon switch. On the
other hand, in the case of attractive interaction, the system can exhibit
either anti-bunching or bunching, which is in stark contrast to semiclassical
calculations. We show that the bunching behavior is related to the resonant
excitation of bound states of photons inside the system.

two atomic states but may induce considerable phase shifts. The acquired phases
are usually calculated by using the adiabatic-elimination approximation. We
analyze the accuracy of this approximation and derive the conditions for its

of imperfections, ranging from higher terms in the adiabatic-elimination
expansion and irreversible population loss to couplings to additional states.
We find that, as far as the phase shifts are concerned, the adiabatic
elimination is accurate only for a very large detuning. We show that the
adiabatic approximation is a far more accurate method for evaluating the phase
shifts, with a vast domain of validity; the accuracy is further enhanced by
superadiabatic corrections, which reduce the error well below $10^{-4}$.
Moreover, owing to the effect of adiabatic population return, the adiabatic and
superadiabatic approximations allow one to calculate the phase shifts even for
a moderately large detuning, and even when the peak Rabi frequency is larger
than the detuning; in these regimes the adiabatic elimination is completely
inapplicable. We also derive several exact expressions for the phases using
exactly soluble two-state and three-state analytical models.

of real-space discretized Hamiltonians lead to polynomial errors in
discretization spacing $\Delta$. Here we show that the method based on the
diagonalization of the short-time evolution operators leads to substantially
smaller discretization errors, vanishing exponentially with $1/\Delta^2$. As a
result, the presented calculation scheme is particularly well suited for
numerical studies of few-body quantum systems. The analytically derived
discretization errors estimates are numerically shown to hold for several
models. In the followup paper [1] we present and analyze substantial
improvements that result from the merger of this approach with the recently
introduced effective-action scheme for high-precision calculation of short-time
propagation.

addition to causality, the following postulates have been considered: PFAITH
(existence of a pure preparationally faithful state), and FAITHE (existence of
a faithful effect). These postulates have exhibited an unexpected theoretical
power, excluding all known nonquantum probabilistic theories. Later in Ref. [2]
in addition to causality and PFAITH, postulate LDISCR (local discriminability)
and PURIFY (purifiability of all states) have been considered, narrowing the
probabilistic theory to something very close to Quantum Mechanics. In the
present paper we test the above postulates on some nonquantum probabilistic
models. The first model, ""the two-box world"" is an extension of the

mathematical structure, including classical probabilities, quantum mechanics as
well as Jordan algebras. This structure exhibits some similarities with Alfsen
and Shultz's non-commutative spectral theory, but these two mathematical
approaches are not identical. Barnum, Emerson and Ududec adapted the concept of
higher-order interference, introduced by Sorkin in 1994, into a general
probabilistic framework. Their adaption is used here to reveal a close link
between the existence of the Jordan product and the non-existence of
interference of third or higher order in those quantum logics which entail a
reasonable calculus of conditional probability. The complete characterization
of the Jordan algebraic structure requires the following three further
postulates: a Hahn-Jordan decomposition property for the states, a polynomial
functional calculus for the observables, and the positivity of the square of an
observable. While classical probabilities are characterized by the absence of
any kind of interference, the absence of interference of third (and higher)
order thus characterizes a probability calculus which comes close to quantum
mechanics, but still includes the exceptional Jordan algebras.

diagonalization, we investigate the behavior of pairwise and block entanglement

that pairwise entanglement fails in the characterization of the infinite-order

quadrature noise spectrum of the field after propagating through the medium in
the case where the field has a general (but small) noise spectrum and the atoms
are in a coherent population trapping state and show electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT). Although the mean values of the field remain
unaltered as the field propagates, there is an oscillatory interchange of noise
properties between the probe and pump fields. Also, as the field propagates,
there is an oscillatory creation and annihilation of correlations between the
probe and pump quadratures. We further study the field propagation of squeezed
states when there is two-photon resonance, but the field has a detuning
$\delta$ from atomic resonance. We show that the field propagation is very
sensitive to $\delta$. The propagation in this case can be explained as a
combination of a frequency dependent rotation of maximum squeezed quadrature

over weak classifiers. Our motivation was to cast the training of a classifier
into a format amenable to solution by the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Applying
adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) promises to yield solutions that are superior
to those which can be achieved with classical heuristic solvers. Interestingly
we found that by using heuristic solvers to obtain approximate solutions we
could already gain an advantage over the standard method AdaBoost. In this
communication we generalize the baseline method to large scale classifier
training. By large scale we mean that either the cardinality of the dictionary
of candidate weak classifiers or the number of weak learners used in the strong
classifier exceed the number of variables that can be handled effectively in a
single global optimization. For such situations we propose an iterative and
piecewise approach in which a subset of weak classifiers is selected in each
iteration via global optimization. The strong classifier is then constructed by
concatenating the subsets of weak classifiers. We show in numerical studies
that the generalized method again successfully competes with AdaBoost. We also
provide theoretical arguments as to why the proposed optimization method, which
does not only minimize the empirical loss but also adds L0-norm regularization,
is superior to versions of boosting that only minimize the empirical loss. By
conducting a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation we gather evidence that the quantum

that as long as one and the same probability distribution is used in the

partial transposes (PT's) of the associated 4 x 4 density matrices). But the
full implementation of the test--requiring that the determinant of the PT be
nonnegative for separability to hold--appears to be, at least presently,
computationally intractable. So, we have previously implemented--using the
auxiliary concept of a diagonal-entry-parameterized separability function
(DESF)--the weaker implied test of nonnegativity of the six 2 x 2 principal
minors of the PT. This yielded an exact upper bound on the separability
probability of 1024/{135 pi^2} =0.76854$. Here, we piece together
(reflection-symmetric) results obtained by requiring that each of the four 3 x
3 principal minors of the PT, in turn, be nonnegative, giving an
improved/reduced upper bound of 22/35 = 0.628571. Then, we conclude that a
still further improved upper bound of 1129/2100 = 0.537619 can be found by
similarly piecing together the (reflection-symmetric) results of enforcing the
simultaneous nonnegativity of certain pairs of the four 3 x 3 principal minors.
In deriving our improved upper bounds, we rely repeatedly upon the use of
certain integrals over cubes that arise. Finally, we apply an independence
assumption to a pair of DESF's that comes close to reproducing our numerical

  QED","M. M. Aghili Yajadda","  The cluster state quantum computation is a versatile approach to build a

one dimensional array of double quantum dots with long spin relaxation time can
evolve to a cluster state via capacitive coupling to a transmission line
resonator. By applying an oscillating voltage to gates of the double quantum
dots, we prove that the evolution operator for such interaction is an
Ising-like operator. Subsequently, the interacting qubits will become highly
entangled that we realize a cluster state. Furthermore, we propose an
experiment to investigate validity of our theoretical method. Considering the
current advanced technology in semiconductor nanofabrication, our proposed
structure can be integrated on a chip where provides scalability and convenient
control of the qubits. The scalability of our scheme implies that we can expand
this structure to higher dimensional arrays of the qubits where paves the way

"1155","An analog of Heisenberg uncertainty relation in prequantum classical
  field theory","Andrei Khrennikov","  Prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) is a model which
provides a possibility to represent averages of quantum observables, including
correlations of observables on subsystems of a composite system, as averages
with respect to fluctuations of classical random fields. PCSFT is a classical
model of the wave type. For example, ""electron"" is described by electronic
field. In contrast to QM, this field is a real physical field and not a field
of probabilities. An important point is that the prequantum field of e.g.
electron contains the irreducible contribution of the background field, vacuum
fluctuations. In principle, the traditional QM-formalism can be considered as a
special regularization procedure: subtraction of averages with respect to
vacuum fluctuations. In this paper we derive a classical analog of the
Heisenberg-Robertson inequality for dispersions of functionals of classical
(prequantum) fields. PCSFT Robertson-like inequality provides a restriction on
the product of classical dispersions. However, this restriction is not so rigid
as in QM. The quantum dispersion corresponds to the difference between e.g. the
electron field dispersion and the dispersion of vacuum fluctuations. Classical
Robertson-like inequality contains these differences. Hence, it does not imply
such a rigid estimate from below for dispersions as it was done in QM.

thermal environment is non-trivial. The long time limit has three qualitatively
different behaviors (phases) depending on parameters such as the temperature of

cases with non-vanishing long-term entanglement, others with a final
disentangled state, and situations displaying an infinite sequence of events of
disappearance and revival of entanglement. We describe an experiment to realize
these different scenarios in an ion trap. The motional degrees of freedom of
two ions are used to simulate the system while the coupling to an extra
(central) ion, which is continuously laser cooled, is the gateway to a
decohering reservoir. The scheme proposed allows for the observation and
control of motional entanglement dynamics, and is an example of a class of

string in AdS space in the context of both classical and quantum mechanics.
This is done by first deriving the conserved mass per unit length of the

Hamiltonian of the black string. In the quantum mechanical context, we take
primary interest in the behavior of the collapse near the horizon and near the
origin (classical singularity) from the point of view of an infalling observer.
In the absence of radiation, quantum effects near the horizon do not change the
classical conclusions for an infalling observer, meaning that the horizon is
not an obstacle for him/her. The most interesting quantum mechanical effect
comes in when investigating near the origin. First, quantum effects are able to
remove the classical singularity at the origin, since the wave function is
non-singular at the origin. Second, the Schr\""odinger equation describing the
behavior near the origin displays non-local effects, which depend on the energy
density of the domain wall. This is manifest in that derivatives of the
wavefunction at one point are related to the value of the wavefunction at some
other distant point.

space is not informationally complete, it can be used to yield surprisingly
high-fidelity reconstruction. For a d-dimensional Hilbert space with the
initial observable in su(d), the measurement record lacks information about a
matrix subspace of dimension > d-2 out of the total dimension d^2-1. We
determine the conditions on U_0 such that the bound is saturated, and show they
are achieved by almost all pseudorandom unitary matrices. When we further
impose the constraint that the physical density matrix must be positive, we
obtain even higher fidelity than that predicted from the missing subspace. With
prior knowledge that the state is pure, the reconstruction will be perfect (in
the limit of vanishing noise) and for arbitrary mixed states, the fidelity is
over 0.96, even for small d, and reaching F > 0.99 for d > 9. We also study the

code. A bipartite quantum code is one that involves two senders and one
receiver. The two senders exploit both nonlocal and local quantum resources to
encode quantum information with local encoding circuits. They transmit their
encoded quantum data to a single receiver who then decodes the transmitted
quantum information. The nonlocal resources in a bipartite code are ebits and
nonlocal information qubits and the local resources are ancillas and local
information qubits. The technique of bipartite quantum error correction is
useful in both the quantum communication scenario described above and in
fault-tolerant quantum computation. It has application in fault-tolerant
quantum computation because we can prepare nonlocal resources offline and
exploit local encoding circuits. In particular, we derive an encoding circuit
for a bipartite version of the Steane code that is local and additionally
requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. We have simulated this encoding in
the CNOT extended rectangle with a publicly available fault-tolerant simulation
software. The result is that there is an improvement in the ""pseudothreshold""
with respect to the baseline Steane code, under the assumption that quantum
memory errors occur less frequently than quantum gate errors.

bosonic gases differing from single-species spinor gases. We determine the
exact ground states in several parameter regimes, and study the composite
structures by using the generating function method generalized here to be
applicable to a mixture of two species of spinor gases. The most interesting
phase is the so-called entangled Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is
fragmented BEC with quantum entanglement between the two species, and with both
interspecies and intraspecies singlet pairs. For comparison, we also apply the
generating function method to a mixture of two species of pseudospin-1/2 atoms,
for which the total spin quantum number of each species is fixed as half of the
atom number, in contrast with the case of spin-1, for which it is a variable
determined by energetics. Consequently, singlet pairs in entangled BEC of a
pseudospin-1/2 mixture are all interspecies. Interspecies spin exchange leads
to novel features beyond those of spinor BEC of a single species of atoms as
well as mixtures without interspecies spin exchange.

stabilization of a diode laser on several praseodymium lines between 1105 and

observed via laser-induced fluorescence. These signals are strong enough to
lock the diode laser onto most of the lines by using standard laser locking

motions of mechanical oscillators thereby realizing a linear quantum
opto-mechanical coupling. When performing a precise measurement of the position
of an oscillator, this coupling results in quantum radiation pressure noise. Up
to now this effect has not been observed yet. Generally speaking, the strength
of radiation pressure noise increases when the effective mass of the oscillator
is decreased or when the power of the reflected light is increased. Recently,
extremely light SiN membranes with high mechanical Q-values at room temperature
have attracted attention as low thermal noise mechanical oscillators. However,
the power reflectance of these membranes is much lower than unity which makes
the use of advanced interferometer recycling techniques to amplify the
radiation pressure noise in a standard Michelson interferometer inefficient.
Here, we propose and theoretically analyze a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer

can be used even if the reflectance of the membrane is much lower than unity.
In particular, signal-recycling is a useful tool because it does not involve a
power increase at the membrane. We derive the formulas for the quantum

"7338","An Extreme form of Superactivation for Quantum Zero-Error Capacities","Toby S. Cubitt|Graeme Smith","  The zero-error capacity of a channel is the rate at which it can send
information perfectly, with zero probability of error, and has long been
studied in classical information theory. We show that the zero-error capacity
of quantum channels exhibits an extreme form of non-additivity, one which is
not possible for classical channels, or even for the usual capacities of
quantum channels. By combining probabilistic arguments with algebraic geometry,
we prove that there exist channels E1 and E2 with no zero-error classical
capacity whatsoever, C_0(E1) = C_0(E2) = 0, but whose joint zero-error quantum
capacity is positive, Q_0(E1 x E2) >= 1. This striking effect is an extreme
from of the superactivation phenomenon, as it implies that both the classical
and quantum zero-error capacities of these channels can be superactivated
simultaneously, whilst being a strictly stronger property of capacities.
Superactivation of the quantum zero-error capacity was not previously known.

  quantum measurement problem","Kinjalk Lochan|T. P. Singh","  There are four reasons why our present knowledge and understanding of quantum
mechanics could be regarded as incomplete. Firstly, the principle of linear
superposition has not been experimentally tested for position eigenstates of
objects having more than about a thousand atoms. Secondly, there is no
universally agreed upon explanation for the process of quantum measurement.
Thirdly, there is no universally agreed upon explanation for the observed fact
that macroscopic objects are not found in superposition of position
eigenstates. Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, the concept of time is
classical and hence external to quantum mechanics : there should exist an
equivalent reformulation of the theory which does not refer to an external
classical time. In this paper we argue that such a reformulation is the
limiting case of a nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming
important at the Planck mass scale. Such a nonlinearity can provide insights
into the problems mentioned above. We use a physically motivated model for a
nonlinear Schrodinger equation to show that nonlinearity can help in
understanding quantum measurement. We also show that while the principle of
linear superposition holds to a very high accuracy for atomic systems, the
lifetime of a quantum superposition becomes progressively smaller, as one goes
from microscopic to macroscopic objects. This can explain the observed absence
of position superpositions in macroscopic objects [lifetime is too small]. It
also suggests that ongoing laboratory experiments maybe able to detect the
finite superposition lifetime for mesoscopic objects, in the foreseeable
future.

using a microscopic diagrammatic approach. We find, in agreement with some
recent works, that these effects cannot be attributed to variations on the
energy of the EM vacuum but to variations of the dielectric self-energy. This
energy is the result of the interaction of the bare polarizability of the
dielectric constituents with the EM fluctuations of an actually polarized
vacuum. We have found an exact expression for the spectrum of these
fluctuations in a statistically homogeneous dielectric. Those fluctuations turn
out to be different to the ones of normal radiative modes. It is the latter
that carry the zero-point-energy (ZPE). Concerning spontaneous emission, we
clarify the nature of the radiation and the origin of the so-called local field
factors. Essential discrepancies are found with respect to previous works. We

consecutively tests different errors of weight t or less, and employs a
separate n-qubit measurement in each test. In this paper, we suggest an error
grouping technique that allows to simultaneously test large groups of errors in

reduces the number of measurements by about 3^t times. While it still leaves
exponentially many measurements for a generic CWS code, the technique is

  Cavity","Kristian Baumann|Christine Guerlin|Ferdinand Brennecke|Tilman Esslinger","  A phase transition describes the sudden change of state in a physical system,
such as the transition between a fluid and a solid. Quantum gases provide the
opportunity to establish a direct link between experiment and generic models
which capture the underlying physics. A fundamental concept to describe the
collective matter-light interaction is the Dicke model which has been predicted
to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke
quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose-Einstein condensate
coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized
supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-ranged
interactions between the condensed atoms. These are induced by two-photon
processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase
transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating
coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a
spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the phase transition is
mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. The work opens the
field of quantum gases with long-ranged interactions, and provides access to
novel quantum phases.

character of quantum mechanics does not originate from uncertainties caused by
the process of measurement or observation, but rather reflects the presence of
objectively existing vacuum fluctuations whose action on massive particles is
calibrated by Planck's constant and effects an additional irregular motion. We
describe a one-particle system by introducing two equally large sub-ensembles
for each of which one obtains an equation of motion that has the form of a
Navier-Stokes- or ''anti''-Navier-Stokes-type equation, respectively. By
averaging over the total ensemble one obtains a new equation of motion which
can be converted into the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The concept
allows the inclusion of electromagnetic fields and can be extended to
interacting N-particle systems. We analyze the problem of how an experimental
setup can consistently be decomposed into the quantum system under study and
the residual quantum system ''apparatus''. The irregular extra motion of the
particle under study allows a decomposition of the associated ensemble into two
sub-ensembles the members of which perform, respectively, a right-handed or
left-handed irregular circular motion about a given axis which becomes
physically relevant in the presence of a magnetic field. We demonstrate that
this orientation-decomposed ''Zitterbewegung'' behaves - in accordance with
Schroedinger's original idea - as a spin-type angular momentum which appears in
addition to a possible orbital angular moment of the particle. We derive the
non-relativistic time-dependent Pauli equation and propose a theory of the
Stern-Gerlach experiment. The Dirac equation can be derived similarly.

110404 (2009), that a separable bipartite continuous variable quantum system
can violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality via operationally
local transformations. Operationally local transformations are parameterized
only by local variables, however in order to allow violation of the CHSH
inequality a maximally entangled ancilla was necessary. The use of the
entangled ancilla in this scheme caused the state under test to become
dependent on the measurement choice one uses to calculate the CHSH inequality
thus violating one of the assumptions used in deriving a Bell inequality,
namely the `free will' or `statistical independence' assumption. The novelty in
this scheme however is that the measurement settings can be external free
parameters. In this paper we generalize these operationally local
transformations for multipartite Bell inequalities (with dichotomic
observables) and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for violation
within this scheme. Namely, a violation of a multipartite Bell inequality in
this setting is contingent on whether an ancillary system admits any realistic,
local hidden variable model i.e. whether the ancilla violates the given Bell
inequality. These results indicate that violation of a Bell inequality
performed on a system does not necessarily imply that the system is nonlocal.
In fact the system under test may be completely classical. However, nonlocality
must have resided somewhere, this may have been in the environment, the
physical variables used to manipulate the system or the detectors themselves
provided the measurement settings are external free variables.

in this lattice geometry for the first time. In addition to this we study the
physics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in the presence of the
triangular optical lattice potential, especially spin changing dynamics across
the SF-MI transition. Our results suggest that below the SF-MI phase
transition, a well-established mean-field model describes the observed data
when renormalizing the spin-dependent interaction. Interestingly this opens new
perspectives for a lattice driven tuning of a spin dynamics resonance occurring
through the interplay of quadratic Zeeman effect and spin-dependent
interaction. We finally discuss further lattice configurations which can be
realized with our setup.

spatial superpositions that are massive enough to begin to experimentally
access the quantum to classical crossover, and thus force us to consider the
possible ways in which the usual quantum dynamics may be affected. One recent
theoretical proposal describes the crossover from unitary quantum mechanics to
classical dynamics as a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we propose
a specific experimental setup capable of identifying the source of unitarity
breaking in such a mechanism. The experiment is aimed specifically at
clarifying the role played by gravity, and distinguishes the resulting dynamics
from that suggested by alternative scenarios for the quantum to classical
crossover. We give both a theoretical description of the expected dynamics, and
a discussion of the involved experimental parameter values and the proposed

particles break a phase rotation symmetry. Time translation symmetry can be
spontaneously broken in exactly the same way. The order associated with this

quantum state reduction: systems which spontaneously break time translation
symmetry act as ideal measurement machines. In this review the breaking of time
translation symmetry is first compared to that of other symmetries such as
spatial translations and rotations. It is then discussed how broken time
translation symmetry gives rise to the process of quantum state reduction and
how it generates a pointer basis, Born's rule, etc. After a comparison between
this model and alternative approaches to the problem of quantum state
reduction, the experimental implications and possible tests of broken time

obtain a simplified diffusion equation that can be numerically solved and show
quantitatively how the Knight shift and the electron-mediated nuclear spin
flip-flop affect the nuclear spin diffusion. The results explain several recent

under different configurations, including variation of the external magnetic

one-dimensional systems. For two body collisions excitations of transverse
modes are the prerequisite for energy exchange and thermalzation. At very low
temperatures excitations of transverse modes are exponentially suppressed,
thermalization by two body collisions stops and the system should become
integrable. In quantum mechanics virtual excitations of higher radial modes are
possible. These virtually excited radial modes give rise to effective
three-body velocity-changing collisions which lead to thermalization. We show
that these three-body elastic interactions are suppressed by pairwise quantum
correlations when approaching the strongly correlated regime. If the relative
momentum $k$ is small compared to the two-body coupling constant $c$ the
three-particle scattering state is suppressed by a factor of $(k/c)^{12}$,
which is proportional to $\gamma ^{12}$, that is to the square of the
three-body correlation function at zero distance in the limit of the
Lieb-Liniger parameter $\gamma \gg 1$. This demonstrates that in one
dimensional quantum systems it is not the freeze-out of two body collisions but
the strong quantum correlations which ensures absence of thermalization on
experimentally relevant time scales.

Bob, and ask how much quantum communication is needed to transfer the full
state to Bob. This problem is known as state merging and was introduced in
[Horodecki et al., Nature, 436, 673 (2005)]. It has been shown that for free
classical communication the minimal number of quantum bits that need to be sent
from Alice to Bob is given by the conditional von Neumann entropy. However this
result only holds asymptotically (in the sense that Alice and Bob share
initially many identical copies of the state) and it was unclear how much
quantum communication is necessary to merge a single copy. We show that the
minimal amount of quantum communication needed to achieve this single-shot
state merging is given by minus the smooth conditional min-entropy of Alice
conditioned on the environment. This gives an operational meaning to the smooth
conditional min-entropy.

diagrammatic device for showing how apertures on the apparatuses are placed
next to each other. Mathematical objects are defined in terms of the circuit
understood graphically. In particular, we do not think of the circuit as
sitting in a background time. Circuits can be foliated by hypersurfaces
comprised of sets of wires. Systems are defined to be associated with wires. A
closable set of operations is defined to be one for which the probability
associated with any circuit built from this set is independent both of choices
on other circuits and of extra circuitry that may be added to outputs from this
circuit. States can be associated with circuit fragments corresponding to
preparations. These states evolve on passing through circuit fragments
corresponding to transformations. The composition of transformations is
treated. A number of theorems are proven including one which rules out
quaternionic quantum theory. The case of locally tomographic theories (where
local measurements on a systems components suffice to determine the global
state) is considered. For such theories the probability can be calculated for a
circuit from matrices pertaining the operations that comprise that circuit.

chemical processes on the atomic and molecular scale. This work presents a
perspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing
the evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early
developments to the most recent advances. The current experimental successes
would be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser
sources and pulse shapers. The two most critical theoretical insights were (1)
realizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via
manipulation of quantum interferences and (2) understanding that optimally
shaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the
desired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these
theoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial
concept of adaptive feedback control, which is a laboratory procedure employing
measurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of
femtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the
desired objective. Optimization in adaptive feedback control experiments is
guided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be
especially effective. Adaptive feedback control of quantum phenomena has found
numerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and
this paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include
quantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of
theoretical control designs in experimental realizations, and real-time quantum
feedback control. The paper concludes with a prospective of open research
directions that are likely to attract significant attention in the future.

computation does not satisfy the requirement. At the fundamental physical
level, it is a network of two body interactions, each the input-output
transformation of a universal Boolean gate. Thus, it cannot process together at
the same time more than the three bit input of this gate - many such gates in
parallel do not count since the information is not processed together. Quantum
computation satisfies the requirement. At the light of our recent explanation
of the speed up, quantum measurement of the solution of the problem is
analogous to a many body interaction between the parts of a perfect classical
machine, whose mechanical constraints represent the problem to be solved. The
many body interaction satisfies all the constraints together at the same time,
producing the solution in one shot. This shades light on the physical
computation level of the theories that place consciousness in quantum
measurement and explains how informations coming from disparate sensorial

subsets of, and states, by vectors in, an ordered real Hilbert space -- in the

discord and the relative entropy of entanglement. Here, we show that the
relative entropy of entanglement admits a simple analytic form when dynamics
and accessible degrees of freedom are restricted to a zero- and
single-excitation subspace. We also simulate and calculate the amount of
quantum discord that is present in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein complex
during the transfer of an excitation from a chlorosome antenna to a reaction
center. We find that the single-excitation quantum discord and relative entropy
of entanglement are equal for all of our numerical simulations, but a proof of
their general equality for this setting evades us for now. Also, some of our
simulations demonstrate that the relative entropy of entanglement without the
single-excitation restriction is much lower than the quantum discord. The first
picosecond of dynamics is the relevant timescale for the transfer of the
excitation, according to some sources in the literature. Our simulation results
indicate that quantum correlations contribute a significant fraction of the
total correlation during this first picosecond in many cases, at both cryogenic
and physiological temperature.

"6540","Ensemble Steering, Weak Self-Duality, and the Structure of Probabilistic
  Theories","Howard Barnum|Carl Phillipp Gaebler|Alexander Wilce","  In any probabilistic theory, we may say a bipartite state on a composite
system AB steers its marginal state (on, say, system B) if, for any
decomposition of the marginal as a mixture, with probabilities p_i, of states
b_i of B, there exists an observable a_i on A such that the states of B
conditional on getting outcome a_i on A, are exactly the states b_i, and the
probabilities of outcomes a_i are p_i. This is always so for pure bipartite
states in quantum mechanics, a fact first observed by Schroedinger in 1935.
Here, we show that, for weakly self-dual state spaces (those isomorphic, but
perhaps not canonically isomorphic, to their dual spaces), the assumption that
every state of a system A is steered by some bipartite state of a composite AA
consisting of two copies of A, amounts to the homogeneity of the state cone. If
the state space is actually self-dual, and not just weakly so, this implies
(via the Koecher-Vinberg Theorem) that it is the self-adjoint part of a
formally real Jordan algebra, and hence, quite close to being quantum
mechanical.

"6640","Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem","Charles H. Bennett|Igor Devetak|Aram W. Harrow|Peter W. Shor|Andreas Winter","  Dual to the usual noisy channel coding problem, where a noisy (classical or
quantum) channel is used to simulate a noiseless one, reverse Shannon theorems
concern the use of noiseless channels to simulate noisy ones, and more
generally the use of one noisy channel to simulate another. For channels of
nonzero capacity, this simulation is always possible, but for it to be
efficient, auxiliary resources of the proper kind and amount are generally
required. In the classical case, shared randomness between sender and receiver
is a sufficient auxiliary resource, regardless of the nature of the source, but
in the quantum case the requisite auxiliary resources for efficient simulation
depend on both the channel being simulated, and the source from which the
channel inputs are coming. For tensor power sources (the quantum generalization
of classical IID sources), entanglement in the form of standard ebits
(maximally entangled pairs of qubits) is sufficient, but for general sources,
which may be arbitrarily correlated or entangled across channel inputs,
additional resources, such as entanglement-embezzling states or backward
communication, are generally needed. Combining existing and new results, we
establish the amounts of communication and auxiliary resources needed in both
the classical and quantum cases, the tradeoffs among them, and the loss of
simulation efficiency when auxiliary resources are absent or insufficient. In
particular we find a new single-letter expression for the excess forward
communication cost of coherent feedback simulations of quantum channels (i.e.
simulations in which the sender retains what would escape into the environment
in an ordinary simulation), on non-tensor-power sources in the presence of
unlimited ebits but no other auxiliary resource. Our results on tensor power
sources establish a strong converse to the entanglement-assisted capacity
theorem.

"6740","Trevisan's extractor in the presence of quantum side information","Anindya De|Christopher Portmann|Thomas Vidick|Renato Renner","  Randomness extraction involves the processing of purely classical information
and is therefore usually studied in the framework of classical probability
theory. However, such a classical treatment is generally too restrictive for
applications, where side information about the values taken by classical random
variables may be represented by the state of a quantum system. This is
particularly relevant in the context of cryptography, where an adversary may
make use of quantum devices. Here, we show that the well known construction
paradigm for extractors proposed by Trevisan is sound in the presence of
quantum side information.
  We exploit the modularity of this paradigm to give several concrete extractor
constructions, which, e.g, extract all the conditional (smooth) min-entropy of
the source using a seed of length poly-logarithmic in the input, or only
require the seed to be weakly random.

algorithms whose queries to the input do not depend on the result of previous

algorithm that computes some total boolean function depending on n variables
must make Omega(n) queries to the input in total. Second, we show that, if
there exists a quantum algorithm that uses k nonadaptive oracle queries to
learn which one of a set of m boolean functions it has been given, there exists
a nonadaptive classical algorithm using O(k log m) queries to solve the same
problem. Thus, in the nonadaptive setting, quantum algorithms can achieve at
most a very limited speed-up over classical query algorithms.

  two-dimensional superfluids following a quantum quench","L. Mathey|A. Polkovnikov","  We study the dynamics of the relative phase of a bilayer of two-dimensional
superfluids after the two superfluids have been decoupled. We find that on
short time scales the relative phase shows ""light cone"" like dynamics and
creates a metastable superfluid state, which can be supercritical. We also
demonstrate similar light cone dynamics for the transverse field Ising model.
On longer time scales the supercritical state relaxes to a disordered state due
to dynamical vortex unbinding. This scenario of dynamically suppressed vortex
proliferation constitutes a reverse-Kibble-Zurek effect. We study this effect
both numerically using truncated Wigner approximation and analytically within a
newly suggested time dependent renormalization group approach (RG). In
particular, within RG we show that there are two possible fixed points for the
real time evolution corresponding to the superfluid and normal steady states.
So depending on the initial conditions and the microscopic parameters of the
Hamiltonian the system undergoes a non-equilibrium phase transition of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless type. The time scales for the vortex unbinding near the
critical point are exponentially divergent, similar to the equilibrium case.

"7242","The Lie Algebraic Significance of Symmetric Informationally Complete
  Measurements","D. M. Appleby|Steven T. Flammia|Christopher A. Fuchs","  Examples of symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued
measures (SIC-POVMs) have been constructed in every dimension less than or
equal to 67. However, it remains an open question whether they exist in all
finite dimensions. A SIC-POVM is usually thought of as a highly symmetric
structure in quantum state space. However, its elements can equally well be
regarded as a basis for the Lie algebra gl(d,C). In this paper we examine the
resulting structure constants, which are calculated from the traces of the
triple products of the SIC-POVM elements and which, it turns out, characterize
the SIC-POVM up to unitary equivalence. We show that the structure constants
have numerous remarkable properties. In particular we show that the existence
of a SIC-POVM in dimension d is equivalent to the existence of a certain
structure in the adjoint representation of gl(d,C). We hope that transforming
the problem in this way, from a question about quantum state space to a
question about Lie algebras, may help to make the existence problem tractable.

resilient to many forms of decoherence. The method achieves nearly

proposals of hybrid computation by S. Lloyd and P. van Loock et. al. The model
is based on two observations made about both the discrete and continuous
algorithms already available. First, the Fourier transform is a single-step
operation in a continuous-variable (CV) setting. Additionally, any
implementation of the oracle is nontrivial in both schemes. The steps of the
computation are very similar to those in the CV algorithm, with the main
difference being the way in which the qunats, or quantum units of analogic
information, and the qubits interact in the oracle. Using both discrete and
continuous states of light, linear devices, and photo-detection, an optical
implementation of the oracle is proposed. For simplicity, infinitely squeezed
states are used in the continuous register, whereas the optical qubit is
encoded in the dual-rail logic of the KLM protocol. The initial assumption of
ideal states as qunats will be dropped to study the effects of finite squeezing
in the quality of the computation.
