of detection using beams of neutral polarizable particles. A more careful
analysis of the proposed experiment suffices to show, however, that it cannot
be performed regardless of the strength of the external electric and magnetic

width comprised of two straight regions connected by a region of constant
curvature. We introduce a numerical method which permits high accuracy at high

and reflection matrices, ${\cal T}$ and ${\cal R}$ and focus on the nature of
the resonances which occur in the vicinity of channel thresholds. We explore
the dependence of these solutions on the curvature of the tube and angle of the
bend and discuss several limiting cases where our numerical results confirm
analytic predictions.

"6","Decoherence of Hydrodynamic Histories: A Simple Spin Model","T. A. Brun|J. J. Halliwell","  In the context of the decoherent histories approach to the quantum mechanics
of closed systems, Gell-Mann and Hartle have argued that the variables
typically characterizing the quasiclassical domain of a large complex system
are the integrals over small volumes of locally conserved densities --
hydrodynamic variables. The aim of this paper is to exhibit some simple models
in which approximate decoherence arises as a result of local conservation. We
derive a formula which shows the explicit connection between local conservation
and approximate decoherence. We then consider a class of models consisting of a
large number of weakly interacting components, in which the projections onto
local densities may be decomposed into projections onto one of two alternatives
of the individual components. The main example we consider is a one-dimensional
chain of locally coupled spins, and the projections are onto the total spin in
a subsection of the chain. We compute the decoherence functional for histories
of local densities, in the limit when the number of components is very large.
We find that decoherence requires two things: the smearing volumes must be
sufficiently large to ensure approximate conservation, and the local densities
must be partitioned into sufficiently large ranges to ensure protection against
quantum fluctuations.

"9","Pole_Factorization Theorem in Quantum Electrodynamics","Henry P. Stapp","  In quantum electrodynamics a classical part of the S-matrix is normally
factored out in order to obtain a quantum remainder that can be treated
perturbatively without the occurrence of infrared divergences. However, this
separation, as usually performed, introduces spurious large-distance effects
that produce an apparent breakdown of the important correspondence between
stable particles and poles of the S-matrix, and, consequently, lead to apparent
violations of the correspondence principle and to incorrect results for
computations in the mesoscopic domain lying between the atomic and classical
regimes. An improved computational technique is described that allows valid
results to be obtained in this domain, and that leads, for the quantum
remainder, in the cases studied, to a physical-region singularity structure
that, as regards the most singular parts, is the same as the normal
physical-region analytic structure in theories in which all particles have
non-zero mass. The key innovations are to define the classical part in
coordinate space, rather than in momentum space, and to define there a
separation of the photon-electron coupling into its classical and quantum parts
that has the following properties: 1) The contributions from the terms
containing only classical couplings can be summed to all orders to give a
unitary operator that generates the coherent state that corresponds to the
appropriate classical process, and 2) The quantum remainder can be rigorously
shown to exhibit, as regards its most singular parts, the normal analytic
structure.

"12","Analog of Lie Algebra and Lie Group for Quantum Non-Hamiltonian Systems","Vasily E. Tarasov","  Quantum mechanics of Hamiltonian (non-dissipative) systems uses Lie algebra
and analytic group (Lie group). In order to describe non-Hamiltonian
(dissipative) systems in quantum theory we need to use non-Lie algebra and
analytic quasigroup (loop).
  The author derives that analog of Lie algebra for quantum non-Hamiltonian
systems is commutant Lie algebra and analog of Lie group for these systems is
analytic commutant associative loop (Valya loop). A commutant Lie algebra is an
algebra such that commutant (a subspace which is generated by all commutators)
is a Lie subalgebra. Valya loop is a non-associative loop such that the
commutant of this loop is associative subloop (group). We prove that a tangent
algebra of Valya loop is a commutant Lie algebra. It is shown that generalized
Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, suggested by the author to describe quantum
non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) systems, is a commutant Lie algebra. As the other
example of commutant Lie algebra, it is considered a generalized Poisson
algebra for differential 1-forms.
  Note that non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) quantum theory has a broad range of
application for non-critical strings in ""coupling constant"" phase space and
bosonic string in non-Riemannian (for example, affine-metric) curved space
which are non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) systems.

examine the localised states of a large condensed object in the context of a

usually described by a linear superposition of low-lying energy eigenstates, it
has been found that localised states of this type correspond to a nearly

of the dependence of the center of mass position spread on the number of

  field","Gregor Tanner|Kai T. Hansen|Jorg Main","  We present the first purely semiclassical calculation of the resonance
spectrum in the Diamagnetic Kepler problem (DKP), a hydrogen atom in a constant
magnetic field with $L_z =0$. The classical system is unbound and completely
chaotic for a scaled energy $\epsilon \sim E B^{-2/3}$ larger than a critical
value $\epsilon_c >0$. The quantum mechanical resonances can in semiclassical
approximation be expressed as the zeros of the semiclassical zeta function, a
product over all the periodic orbits of the underlying classical dynamics.
Intermittency originating from the asymptotically separable limit of the
potential at large electron--nucleus distance causes divergences in the
periodic orbit formula. Using a regularisation technique introduced in [G.\
Tanner and D.\ Wintgen, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\bf 75}, 2928 (1995)] together with a
modified cycle expansion, we calculate semiclassical resonances, both position
and width, which are in good agreement with quantum mechanical results obtained
by the method of complex rotation. The method also provides good estimates for
the bound state spectrum obtained here from the classical dynamics of a
scattering system. A quasi Einstein--Brillouin--Keller (QEBK) quantisation is
derived that allows for a description of the spectrum in terms of approximate
quantum numbers and yields the correct asymptotic behaviour of the
Rydberg--like series converging towards the different Landau thresholds.

"16","Naive Realism about Operators","Martin Daumer|Detlef D√ºrr|Sheldon Goldstein|Nino Zangh√¨","  A source of much difficulty and confusion in the interpretation of quantum
mechanics is a ``naive realism about operators.'' By this we refer to various
ways of taking too seriously the notion of operator-as-observable, and in
particular to the all too casual talk about ``measuring operators'' that occurs
when the subject is quantum mechanics. Without a specification of what should
be meant by ``measuring'' a quantum observable, such an expression can have no
clear meaning. A definite specification is provided by Bohmian mechanics, a
theory that emerges from Sch\""rodinger's equation for a system of particles
when we merely insist that ``particles'' means particles. Bohmian mechanics
clarifies the status and the role of operators as observables in quantum
mechanics by providing the operational details absent from standard quantum
mechanics. It thereby allows us to readily dismiss all the radical claims
traditionally enveloping the transition from the classical to the quantum
realm---for example, that we must abandon classical logic or classical
probability. The moral is rather simple: Beware naive realism, especially about
operators!

"17","Manifestly Covariant Approach to Bargmann-Wigner Fields (I): Generalized

  It is shown that there exists some freedom in the choice of the form of the

family of world-vectors. The standard choice of the product corresponds to
timelike and equal vectors which define a ``time"" direction. The generalized
form shows that formulas are simpler if one chooses {\it null\/} directions.
This freedom is used to derive simple covariant formulas for momentum-space
wave functions (generalized Wigner states) corresponding to arbitrary mass and
spin and using eigenstates of the Pauli-Lubanski vector. The eigenstates which
make formulas the simplest correspond to projections of the Pauli-Lubanski
vector on {\it null\/} directions. The new formulation is an alternative to the

process to follow the quantally implemented (via the Born statistical
postulate) evolution, then we arrive at the jump process which \it can \rm be
interpreted as a Markov process if restricted to a suitable duration time.
However, there is no corresponding Markov process consistent with the $Z_2$
event space assumption, if we require its existence for all times $t\in R_+$.

cations in quantum cryptography and quantum computation theory. The results
reported include the following. An exact expression for the quantum fidelity
between two mixed states is derived. The optimal measurement that gives rise to
it is studied in detail. Several upper and lower bounds on the quantum mutual
information are derived via similar techniques and compared to each other. Of
note is a simple derivation of the important upper bound first proved by Holevo
and an explicit expression for another (tighter) upper bound that appears
implicitly in the same derivation. Several upper and lower bounds to the quan-
tum Kullback relative information are derived. The measures developed are also
applied to ferreting out the extent to which quantum systems must be disturbed
by information gathering measurements. This is tackled in two ways. The first
is in setting up a general formalism for describing the tradeoff between
inference and disturbance. The main point of this is that it gives a way of
expressing the problem so that it appears as algebraic as that of the problem
of finding quantum distinguishability measures. The second result on this theme
is a theorem that prohibits ""broadcasting"" an unknown (mixed) quantum state.
That is to say, there is no way to replicate an unknown quantum state onto two
separate quantum systems when each system is considered without regard to the
other. This includes the possibility of correlation or quantum entanglement
between the systems. This result is a significant extension and generalization
of the standard ""no-cloning"" theorem for pure states.

their limitations assessed. A quantum channel can recover from arbitrary
decoherence of x qubits if K bits of quantum information are encoded using n
quantum bits, where K/n can be greater than 1-2 H(2x/n), but must be less than
1 - 2 H(x/n). This implies exponential reduction of decoherence with only a
polynomial increase in the computing resources required. Therefore quantum
computation can be made free of errors in the presence of physically realistic

"36","Scientific Knowledge from the Perspective of Quantum Cosmology","James B. Hartle","  Existing physical theories do not predict every feature of our experience but
only certain regularities of that experience. That difference between what
could be observed and what can be predicted is one kind of limit on scientific
knowledge. Such limits are inevitable if the world is complex and the laws
governing the regularities of that world are simple. Another kind of limit on
scientific knowledge arises because even simple theories may require
intractable or impossible computations to yield specific predictions. A third
kind of limit concerns our ability to know theories through the process of
induction and test. Quantum cosmology -- that part of science concerned with
the quantum origin of the universe and its subsequent evolution -- displays all
three kinds of limits. This paper briefly describes quantum cosmology and
discusses these limits. The place of the other sciences in this most
comprehensive of physical frameworks is described.

"37","Universal Superpositions of Coherent States and Self-Similar Potentials","V. Spiridonov","  A variety of coherent states of the harmonic oscillator is considered. It is
formed by a particular superposition of canonical coherent states. In the
simplest case, these superpositions are eigenfunctions of the annihilation
operator $A=P(d/dx+x)/\sqrt2$, where $P$ is the parity operator. Such $A$
arises naturally in the $q\to -1$ limit for a symmetry operator of a specific
self-similar potential obeying the $q$-Weyl algebra, $AA^\dagger-q^2A^\dagger
A=1$. Coherent states for this and other reflectionless potentials whose
discrete spectra consist of $N$ geometric series are analyzed. In the harmonic
oscillator limit the surviving part of these states takes the form of
orthonormal superpositions of $N$ canonical coherent states
$|\epsilon^k\alpha\rangle$, $k=0, 1, \dots, N-1$, where $\epsilon$ is a
primitive $N$th root of unity, $\epsilon^N=1$. A class of $q$-coherent states
related to the bilateral $q$-hypergeometric series and Ramanujan type integrals
is described. It includes a curious set of coherent states of the free
nonrelativistic particle which is interpreted as a $q$-algebraic system without
discrete spectrum. A special degenerate form of the symmetry algebras of
self-similar potentials is found to provide a natural $q$-analog of the Floquet
theory. Some properties of the factorization method, which is used throughout
the paper, are discussed from the differential Galois theory point of view.

derive an equivalent form of the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation, the
so-called sum rule, in which both the high-frequency part of Im $\Pi$ in the
dispersion integral and the high-order contribution to $\Pi$ are suppressed. We
provide a general framework for derivation of such sum rules, without any
recourse to an infinite-order differential operator. We derive sum rules for a
wide set of weight functions and show that any departure from the $e^{-t}$
behaviour of the weight function in sum rules leads to modulating factors on
the theoretical side of sum rules, providing its low frequency regularization.
We argue that by including modulating factors one can extend the domain of
validity of sum rules further to an intermediate region of frequencies and can
account for ``bumps"" which were observed numerically on the phenomenological
side of sum rules at ``intermediate'' frequencies.

initiated by Duru and Kleinert is studied by recognizing it as a special case
of the general treatment of the separable Hamiltonian of Liouville-type. The
basic dynamical principle involved is identified as the Jacobi's principle of
least action for given energy which is reparametrization invariant, and thus
the appearance of a gauge freedom is naturally understood. The separation of
variables in operator formalism corresponds to a choice of gauge in path
integral, and the Green's function is shown to be gauge independent if the
operator ordering is properly taken into account. Unlike the conventional
Feynman path integral,which deals with a space-time picture of particle motion,
the path integral on the basis of the Jacobi's principle sums over orbits in
space. We illustrate these properties by evaluating an exact path integral of
the Green's function for the hydrogen atom in parabolic coordinates, and thus
avoiding the use of the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation. In the present

anharmonic oscillators with an unstable quartic coupling. We also study the

momentum. However, consistency with the solutions of the Dirac equation limits
the possibilities such that conservation of angular momentum is restored.

"71","Locality, Independence and the Pro-Liberty Bell","Huw Price","  Construed as an argument against hidden variable theories, Bell's Theorem
assumes that hidden variables would be independent of future measurement
settings. This Independence Assumption (IA) is rarely questioned. Bell
considered relaxing it to avoid non-locality, but thought that the resulting
view left no room for free will. However, Bell seems to have failed to
distinguish two different strategies for giving up IA. One strategy takes for
granted the Principle of the Common Cause, which requires that a correlation
between hidden variables and measurement settings be explained by a joint
correlation with some unknown factor in their common past. The other strategy
rejects the Principle of the Common Cause, and argues that the required
correlation might be due to the known interaction between the object system and
the measuring device in their common future. Bell and most others who have
discussed these issues have focussed on the former strategy, but because the
two approaches have not been properly distinguished, it has not been well
appreciated that there is a quite different way to relax IA. This paper
distinguishes the two strategies, and argues that the latter is considerably
more appealing than the former.

measurements carried out at definite moments of time. However, realistic
measurements do not take place in an instant, but are extended over a period of
time. The assumption of instantaneous alternatives in usual quantum mechanics
is an approximation whose validity can be investigated in the generalized
quantum mechanics of closed systems in which probabilities are predicted for
spacetime alternatives that extend over time. In this paper we investigate how
alternatives extended over time reduce to the usual instantaneous alternatives
in a simple model in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show
how the decoherence of a particular set of spacetime alternatives becomes
automatic as the time over which they extend approaches zero and estimate how
large this time can be before the interference between the alternatives becomes
non-negligible. These results suggest that the time scale over which coarse
grainings of such quantities as the center of mass position of a massive body
may be extended in time before producing significant interference is much
longer than characteristic dynamical time scales.

well as with a function $p:P\times P-> [0,1]$, with certain properties. The
Poisson structure is connected with the transition probabilities through
unitarity (in a specific formulation intrinsic to the given context).
  In classical mechanics, where $p(\rho,\sigma)=\dl_{\rho\sigma}$, unitarity
  poses no restriction on the Poisson structure. Quantum mechanics is
characterized by a specific (complex Hilbert space) form of $p$, and by the
property that the irreducible components of $P$ as a transition probability
space coincide with the symplectic leaves of $P$ as a Poisson space. In
conjunction, these stipulations determine the Poisson structure of quantum

microscopic primordial density fluctuations that are required by the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle into quite macroscopic inhomogeneities, forcing the
current wavefunction of the universe to contain such Byzantine superpositions
as our planet being in many macroscopically different places at once. Since
decoherence bars us from experiencing more than one macroscopic reality, we
would see seemingly complex constellations of stars etc, even if the initial

change among direct-gap insulators and the metal, depending on the degree of
conjugations. High pressure experiments could observe such pressure-induced
metal-insulator transitions. The C60-polymer doped with one electron per one
molecule is always a metal. The energy difference between the highest-occupied
state and the lowest-unoccupied state of the neutral system becomes smaller
upon doping owing to the polaron effects. When the C60-polymer is doped with
two electrons per one C60, the system is insulating. When the conjugation in
the direction of the polymer chain is smaller, it is a direct-gap insulator.
The energy gap becomes indirect when the conjugation is stronger. We also study
the antiferromagnetic phase of AC60 by using a tight-binding model with
long-range Coulomb interactions. The antiferromagnetism is well described by
the model. The comparison with the photoemission studies shows that the new

arising from the transmission of quantum entanglement through (possibly noisy)
quantum channels. A pure entangled state is prepared of a pair of systems $R$
and $Q$, after which $Q$ is subjected to a dynamical evolution given by the
superoperator $\superop^{Q}$. Two interesting quantities can be defined for
this process: the entanglement fidelity $F_{e}$ and the entropy production
$S_{e}$. It turns out that neither of these quantities depends in any way on
the system $R$, but only on the initial state and dynamical evolution of $Q$.
$F_{e}$ and $S_{e}$ are related to various other fidelities and entropies, and
are connected by an inequality reminiscent of the Fano inequality of classical
information theory. Some insight can be gained from these techniques into the
security of quantum cryptographic protocols and the nature of quantum
error-correcting codes.

environment. In an EPP, perfectly entangled pure states are extracted, with
some yield D, from a mixed state M shared by two parties; with a QECC, an arbi-
trary quantum state $|\xi\rangle$ can be transmitted at some rate Q through a
noisy channel $\chi$ without degradation. We prove that an EPP involving one-
way classical communication and acting on mixed state $\hat{M}(\chi)$ (obtained
by sharing halves of EPR pairs through a channel $\chi$) yields a QECC on
$\chi$ with rate $Q=D$, and vice versa. We compare the amount of entanglement
E(M) required to prepare a mixed state M by local actions with the amounts
$D_1(M)$ and $D_2(M)$ that can be locally distilled from it by EPPs using one-
and two-way classical communication respectively, and give an exact expression
for $E(M)$ when $M$ is Bell-diagonal. While EPPs require classical communica-
tion, QECCs do not, and we prove Q is not increased by adding one-way classical
communication. However, both D and Q can be increased by adding two-way com-
munication. We show that certain noisy quantum channels, for example a 50%
depolarizing channel, can be used for reliable transmission of quantum states
if two-way communication is available, but cannot be used if only one-way com-
munication is available. We exhibit a family of codes based on universal hash-
ing able toachieve an asymptotic $Q$ (or $D$) of 1-S for simple noise models,

error-correcting quantum block code. We prove that {\em iff} a QECC results in
high fidelity for the case of no error the QECC can be recast into a form where
the encoder is the matrix inverse of the decoder.

against noise and other unwanted interactions in quantum computation and

encoding states into larger Hilbert spaces subject to known interactions. We
obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the perfect recovery of an
encoded state after its degradation by an interaction. The conditions depend
only on the behavior of the logical states. We use them to give a recovery
operator independent definition of error-correcting codes. We relate this
definition to four others: The existence of a left inverse of the interaction,
an explicit representation of the error syndrome using tensor products, perfect
recovery of the completely entangled state, and an information theoretic
identity. Two notions of fidelity and error for imperfect recovery are
introduced, one for pure and the other for entangled states. The latter is more
appropriate when using codes in a quantum memory or in applications of quantum
teleportation to communication. We show that the error for entangled states is
bounded linearly by the error for pure states. A formal definition of
independent interactions for qubits is given. This leads to lower bounds on the
number of qubits required to correct $e$ errors and a formal proof that the
classical bounds on the probability of error of $e$-error-correcting codes

transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of
long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit
with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per
gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a
polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t)^c) amounts of
inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing
how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were
previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting

processes which evolve quantum ballistically, i.e. motion restricted to a
collection of nonintersecting or distinct paths on an arbitrary basis. The main
goal of this paper is proof of a theorem which gives necessary and sufficient
conditions that T must satisfy so that there exists a Hamiltonian description
of quantum ballistic evolution for the process, namely, that T is a partial
isometry and is orthogonality preserving and stable on some basis. Simple
examples of quantum ballistic evolution for quantum Turing machines with one

for nondeterministic machines the basis set can be quite complex with much

arbitrary deterministic quantum Turing machine, it is decidable if T is stable

The proof fails if T is a step operator for a nondeterministic machine. It is
an open question if such a decision procedure exists for nondeterministic

"202","Quantum Information Theory of Entanglement and Measurement","Nicolas J. Cerf|Chris Adami","  We present a quantum information theory that allows for a consistent
description of entanglement. It parallels classical (Shannon) information
theory but is based entirely on density matrices (rather than probability
distributions) for the description of quantum ensembles. We find that quantum
conditional entropies can be negative for entangled systems, which leads to a
violation of well-known bounds in Shannon information theory. Such a unified
information-theoretic description of classical correlation and quantum
entanglement clarifies the link between them: the latter can be viewed as
``super-correlation'' which can induce classical correlation when considering a
tripartite or larger system. Furthermore, negative entropy and the associated
clarification of entanglement paves the way to a natural information-theoretic
description of the measurement process. This model, while unitary and causal,
implies the well-known probabilistic results of conventional quantum mechanics.
It also results in a simple interpretation of the Kholevo theorem limiting the
accessible information in a quantum measurement.

applying nonholonomic coordinate transformations to ideal crystals. In the

nontrivial Jacobian in the path measure which in a curved space produces
  an additional term proportional to the curvature scalar canceling a similar
term found earlier by DeWitt from a naive formulation of Feynman's time-sliced
path integral. This cancelation is important in correctly describing
semiclassically and quantum mechanically various systems such as the hydrogen

confined initially in a finite region of space, extending our analysis given
recently (Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 337 (1995)). For this purpose, we solve exactly
the time-dependent Schroedinger equation for a finite-range potential. We
calculate and compare two quantities: (i) the survival probability S(t), i.e.,
the probability that the particle is in the initial state after a time t; and
(ii) the nonescape probability P(t), i.e., the probability that the particle
remains confined inside the potential region after a time t. We analyze in
detail the resonant and nonresonant decay. In the former case, after a very
short time, S(t) and P(t) decay exponentially, but for very long times they
decay as a power law, albeit with different exponents. For the nonresonant case
we obtain that both quantities differ initially. However, independently of the
resonant and nonresonant character of the initial state we always find a
transition to the ground state of the system which indicates a process of
``loss of memory'' in the decay.

The bound state--problem is analogous to that of point interactions in the
plane: since a two--dimensional point interaction is never repulsive, there are
$ m $ discrete eigenvalues, $ 1\le m\le N $, the lowest of which is
nondegenerate. On the other hand, due to the presence of the boundary the point
interactions give rise to infinite series of resonances; if the coupling is
weak they approach the thresholds of higher transverse modes. We derive also
spectral and scattering properties for point perturbations in several related

by a magnetic flux, and a straight strip which supports a potential independent
of the transverse coordinate. As for strips with an infinite number of point
perturbations, we restrict ourselves to the situation when the latter are

about physical observables and their correlations in a given physical system.
These correlations are logical, hence nonlocal, and exist when the system is

we have computed the static Casimir energy of a spherical cavity in an
otherwise uniform material. As expected the result is divergent; yet a
plausible finite answer is extracted, in the leading uniform asymptotic
approximation. This result agrees with that found using zeta-function
regularization. Numerically, we find far too small an energy to account for the
large burst of photons seen in sonoluminescence. If the divergent result is
retained, it is of the wrong sign to drive the effect. Dispersion does not
resolve this contradiction. In the static approximation, the Fresnel drag term
is zero; on the mother hand, electrostriction could be comparable to the
Casimir term. It is argued that this adiabatic approximation to the dynamical
Casimir effect should be quite accurate.

desirable to measure not merely the square modulus of the spatial wavefunction,

and how pure the state is. An experimental setup is presented which can measure
the density matrix (or equivalently, the Wigner function) of a beam of
identically prepared charged particles to an arbitrary accuracy, limited only
by count statistics and detector resolution. The particles enter into an
electric field causing simple harmonic oscillation in the transverse direction.
This corresponds to rotating the Wigner function in phase space. With a
slidable detector, the marginal distribution of the Wigner function can be
measured from all angles. Thus the phase-space tomography formalism can be used
to recover the Wigner function by the standard inversion of the Radon
transform. By applying this technique to for instance double-slit experiments
with various degrees of environment-induced decoherence, it should be possible
to make our understanding of decoherence and apparent wave-function collapse
less qualitative and more quantitative.

property that inferences made by ordered consistent sets do not violate

and (ii) the so-called ""quantum"" part, that is, the 3-velocity V of the motion
IN the CM frame (namely, the internal ""spin motion"" or zitterbewegung). By
inserting such a complete, composite expression of the velocity into the
kinetic energy term of the non-relativistic classical (i.e., newtonian)

but Lorentz symmetry is exactly preserved in agreement with local properties of

thickness give rise to a singly connected state in which the order parameter
vanishes at a suitable layer, so that the superconducting part does not enclose

line segment in the magnetic field-temperature plane, delimited by two critical
points. The phase diagram contains several bifurcation lines, which are

exponential localization generally occurs for $\eta$ (a scaled $\hbar$) in the
infinitesimal vicinity of QAR points $\eta_0$. The localization length $\xi_0$
is determined from the analytical properties of the kicking potential. This
``QAR-localization"" is associated in some cases with an integrable limit of the

QAR-localization is an excellent approximation to DL sufficiently close to QAR.
The transition from QAR-localization to DL in a semiclassical regime, as $\eta$

some known results for the squeezed input states are reviewed. It is shown that
the phase sensitivity for an interferometer that employs squeezing-producing

(i) fixed input state and variable interferometer, and (ii) fixed
interferometer and variable input state. The behavior of the phase sensitivity

$\bar{N}$ is the total number of photons passing through the phase shifters of
the interferometer) without adding four-wave mixers. This avoids the duality in
the behavior of the phase sensitivity that occurs for the squeezed input. On

localization time is typically greater than the decoherence time, but much

that the reduced density operator rapidly evolves into a state which is
approximately diagonal in a set of generalized coherent states. We thus
reproduce, using a completely different method, a result we previously obtained
using the quantum state diffusion picture (Phys.Rev. D52, 7294 (1995)). We also
go beyond this earlier result, in that we derive an explicit expression for the
weighting of each phase space localized state in the approximately diagonal
density matrix, as a function of the initial state. For sufficiently long times
it is equal to the Wigner function, and we confirm that the Wigner function is
positive for times greater than the localization time (multiplied by a number

that the problem can be mapped onto an effective one-dimensional one, and the
tunneling rate is strongly affected by the magnetic field, such as a complete
suppression by a large parallel magnetic field, an example of the dynamical
localization. In such case a small perpendicular component of the field, or the
dissipation, can enhance the tunneling rate. In the small parallel field and
finite temperatures the tunneling rate is finite. Explicit expressions will be
presented in those cases. If viewing the tunneling in the presence of a
magnetic field as a dissipative tunneling process, by varying the magnetic
field and the potential one can obtain the dissipative spectral function
between the subohmic $s =0$ and the superohmic $s = \infty$. In combination
with a real dissipative spectral function, the effect of the magnetic field can
map the spectral function from $s $ to $2-s$, with $s>2$ mapping to $ s = 0$,
revealing a dual symmetry between the friction and the Lorentz force. Two cases

"616","Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiment with relativistic massive
  particles","Marek Czachor","  The EPRB experiment with massive partcles can be formulated if one defines
spin in a relativistic way. Two versions are discussed: The one using the spin
operator defined via the relativistic center-of-mass operator, and the one
using the Pauli-Lubanski vector. Both are shown to lead to the SAME prediction
for the EPRB experiment: The degree of violation of the Bell inequality
DECREASES with growing velocity of the EPR pair of spin-1/2 particles. The
phenomenon can be physically understood as a combined effect of the Lorentz
contraction and the Moller shift of the relativistic center of mass. The effect
is therefore stronger than standard relativistic phenomena such as the Lorentz
contraction or time dilatation. The fact that the Bell inequality is in general
less violated than in the nonrelativistic case will have to be taken into
account in tests for eavesdropping if massive particles will be used for a key
transfer.

the framework of the operational approach to quantum measurement. We show that
a realistic homodyne measurement is described by a family of operational
observables that depends on the experimental setup, rather than a single field
quadrature operator. We find an explicit form of this family, which fully
characterizes the experimental device and is independent of a specific state of
the measured system. We also derive operational homodyne observables for the
setup with a random phase, which has been recently applied in an ultrafast
measurement of the photon statistics of a pulsed diode laser. The operational
formulation directly gives the relation between the detected noise and the
intrinsic quantum fluctuations of the measured field. We demonstrate this on
two examples: the operational uncertainty relation for the field quadratures,
and the homodyne detection of suppressed fluctuations in photon statistics.

storage. Quantum channels have dual uses: they can be used to transmit known
quantum states which code for classical information, and they can be used in a
purely quantum manner, for transmitting or storing quantum entanglement. We
propose here a definition of the von Neumann capacity of quantum channels,
which is a quantum mechanical extension of the Shannon capacity and reverts to
it in the classical limit. As such, the von Neumann capacity assumes the role
of a classical or quantum capacity depending on the usage of the channel. In
analogy to the classical construction, this capacity is defined as the maximum
von Neumann mutual entropy processed by the channel, a measure which reduces to
the capacity for classical information transmission through quantum channels
(the ""Kholevo capacity"") when known quantum states are sent. The quantum mutual
entropy fulfills all basic requirements for a measure of information, and
observes quantum data-processing inequalities. We also derive a quantum Fano
inequality relating the quantum loss of the channel to the fidelity of the
quantum code. The quantities introduced are calculated explicitly for the
quantum ""depolarizing"" channel. The von Neumann capacity is interpreted within
the context of superdense coding, and an ""extended"" Hamming bound is derived
that is consistent with that capacity.

states of the single-mode quantized radiation field, are introduced and their
nonclassical properties are investigated. Their limits to the binomial states
and to the coherent and number states are studied. The ladder operator
formulation of the hypergeometric states is found and the algebra involved
turns out to be a one-parameter deformation of $su(2)$ algebra. These states
exhibit highly nonclassical properties, like sub-Poissonian character,
antibunching and squeezing effects. The quasiprobability distributions in phase
space, namely the $Q$ and the Wigner functions are studied in detail. These
remarkable properties seem to suggest that the hypergeometric states deserve
further attention from theoretical and applicational sides of quantum optics.

coherence for inhomogeneous perturbations generated from a non-vacuum initial
state in the early Universe is considered in the Heisenberg and the
Schr\""odinger representations, as well as using the Wigner function. We show
explicitly that these three approaches lead to the same prediction in the limit
of large squeezing (i.e. when the squeezing parameter $|r_k|\to \infty$): each
two-modes quantum state (k, -k) of these perturbations is equivalent to a
classical perturbation that has a stochastic amplitude, obeying a non-gaussian
statistics which depends on the initial state, and that belongs to the
quasi-isotropic mode (i.e. it possesses a fixed phase). The Wigner function is
not everywhere positive for any finite $r_k$, hence its interpretation as a
classical distribution function in phase space is impossible without some
coarse graining procedure. However, this does not affect the transition to
semiclassical behaviour since the Wigner function becomes concentrated near a
classical trajectory in phase space when $|r_k|\to \infty$ even without coarse
graining. Deviations of the statistics of the perturbations in real space from
a Gaussian one lie below the cosmic variance level for the N-particles initial
states with N=N(|k|) but may be observable for other initial states without
statistical isotropy or with correlations between different k modes. As a way
to look for this effect, it is proposed to measure the kurtosis of the angular

employing a modified de Broglie relation. Formalizing the wave-function $\psi$

The wave-features can then be referred to physical waves of discrete frequency
$\nu$ and the classical dispersion relation $\lambda \nu = u $, complying with
the classical wave equation. Including external potentials yields the
Schr\""odinger equation, which, in this context, is arbitrary due to the
internal energy components. It can be established that the uncertainty
relations are an expression of this, fundamental, arbitrariness. Electrons and
photons can be described by an identical formalism, providing formulations
equivalent to the Maxwell equations. The wave equations of intrinsic particle
properties are Lorentz invariant considering total energy of particles,
although transformations into a moving reference frame lead to an increase of
intrinsic potentials. Interactions of photons and electrons are treated
extensively, the results achieved are equivalent to the results in quantum
theory. Electrostatic interactions provide, a posteriori, a justification for
the initial assumption of electron-wave stability: the stability of electron
waves can be referred to vanishing intrinsic fields of interaction. The concept
finally allows the conclusion that a significant correlation for a pair of spin

Schrodinger equation that gives a dynamical account of the transformation of
entangled into factorized states and is consistent both with quantum mechanics
and required symmetries. The noisy, non-linear term is a unimodular scalar
multiple of the time reversal operator that must be present whenever a
Hamiltonian term in the Schrodinger equation can distinguish the factorized
constituents of an entangled state. The dynamical mechanism involved in the
transformation of entangled into factorized states provides an explanation for
the fact that Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations appear in a time determined
by the response of the measuring device and independent of the distance between
the particles. The dependence on the response time of the measuring device may
be testable through a delay in observing the collapse of mesoscopic
``Schrodinger cat"" states in ion traps. It is further shown that there are
situations where a two-particle interaction can induce a non-linear term by
virtue of coupling to decay modes that distinguish factorized constituents of
an entangled state. We show that this should happen in the neutral K-meson
system where the entangled $K_L$ state is pushed slightly in the direction of a
factorized constituent ($K_o$ or $\overline{K_o}$) as a consequence of the fact
that these can be distinguished via the sign of the charged lepton in a
semi-leptonic decay mode. The result is a CP violation that is within 20% of

the case where both noise and reversibility are combined and show that the
combined model is weaker than unrestricted computation. In our noisy reversible
circuits, each wire is flipped with probability p each time step, and all the
inputs to the circuit are present in time 0. We prove that any noisy reversible
circuit must have size exponential in its depth in order to compute a function

converted into a noise-resistant reversible one with a blow up in size which is
exponential in the depth. This establishes that noisy reversible computation

  We extend this to quantum circuits(QC). We prove that any noisy QC which is

that a QTM subjected to any amount of noise is worthless. For decohered quantum

is based upon the principle that the output of a laser is well-approximated by
a classical wave of fixed intensity and phase. This principle yields four
quantitative conditions which the output of a device must satisfy in order for
that device to be considered a laser. While explaining these requirements, I
analyse the similarities and differences between atom and photon lasers. I show
how these conditions are satisfied first by an idealized photon laser model,
and then by a more generic model which can apply to atom lasers also. Lastly, I
briefly discuss the current proposals for atom lasers and whether they could be
true lasers.

squeezed systems: an inverted harmonic oscillator and a scalar field mode
evolving in an inflationary universe. For the inverted oscillator with weak
coupling to the bath, at both high and low temperatures, $S\to r $, where r is
the squeeze parameter. In the de Sitter case, at high temperatures, $S\to
(1-c)r$ where $c = \gamma_0/H$, $\gamma_0$ being the coupling to the bath and H
the Hubble constant. These three cases confirm previous results based on more
ad hoc prescriptions for calculating entropy. But at low temperatures, the de
Sitter entropy $S\to (1/2-c)r$ is noticeably different. This result, obtained
from a more rigorous approach, shows that factors usually ignored by the
conventional approaches, i.e., the nature of the environment and the coupling

is largely given by the kinetic energy of the electrons, while the Coulomb
forces are only comparable to the kinetic energy terms close to the atomic
nuclei, where they define the shape and the size of the atomic orbitals. If
atomic orbitals are used as a starting point, the kinetic energy operator is
sufficient to determine the energy of the chemical bond. The simple
mathematical structure of this operator allows a calculation of bond energy as
a function of the distance between the atoms. For Gaussian wavefunctions, it is
possible to calculate this bonding potential analytically, determining the bond
length, the bond energy and the elasticity of the bond from only a single
parameter, the width of the atomic wavefunction. It is shown that the results

directly into those in curved space with torsion. Our procedure evolved from
well-established methods in the theory of plastic deformations, where crystals
with defects are described mathematically as images of ideal crystals under
active nonholonomic coordinate transformations.
  Our mapping procedure may be viewed as a natural extension of Einstein's
famous equivalence principle. When applied to time-sliced path integrals, it
gives rise to a new ""quantum equivalence principle"" which determines short-time
action and measure of fluctuating orbits in spaces with curvature and torsion.
The nonholonomic transformations possesses a nontrivial Jacobian in the path
measure which produces in a curved space an additional term proportional to the
curvature scalar R, thus canceling a similar term found earlier by DeWitt. This
cancelation is important for correctly describing semiclassically and quantum
mechanically various systems such as the hydrogen atom, a particle on the
surface of a sphere, and a spinning top. It is also indispensable for the
process of bosonization, by which Fermi particles are redescribed by those
fields.

"925","Minimal Irreversible Quantum Mechanics","Mario Castagnino|Roberto Laura","  It is demonstrated that, making minimal changes in ordinary quantum
mechanics, a reasonable irreversible quantum mechanics can be obtained. This
theory has a more general spectral decompositions, with eigenvectors
corresponding to unstable states that vanish when $t \to \infty .$ These
''Gamov vectors'' have zero norm, in such a way that the norm and the energy of
the physical states remain constant. The evolution operator has no inverse,
showing that we are really dealing with a time-asymmetric theory. Using
Friedrichs model reasonable physical results are obtained, e. g. : the
remaining of an unstable decaying state reappears, in the continuous spectrum
of the model, with its primitive energy.

laser pulse, and the need for a third auxiliary internal electronic state can
be eliminated.

"945","Asymptotic Redundancies for Universal Quantum Coding","Christian Krattenthaler|Paul Slater","  We investigate the question of whether or not there exists a noncommutative/
quantum extension of a recent (commutative probabilistic) result of Clarke and
Barron. They demonstrated that the Jeffreys' invariant prior of Bayesian theory
yields the common asymptotic (minimax and maximin) redundancy - the excess of
the encoding cost over the source entropy - of universal data compression in a
parametric setting. We study certain probability distributions for the
two-level quantum systems. We are able to compute exact formulas for the
corresponding redundancies, for which we find the asymptotic limits. These
results are very suggestive and do indeed point towards a possible quantum
extension of the result of Clarke and Barron.

"975","Effects of noise on quantum error correction algorithms","Adriano Barenco|Todd A. Brun|Ruediger Schack|Tim Spiller","  It has recently been shown that there are efficient algorithms for quantum
computers to solve certain problems, such as prime factorization, which are
intractable to date on classical computers. The chances for practical
implementation, however, are limited by decoherence, in which the effect of an
external environment causes random errors in the quantum calculation. To combat
this problem, quantum error correction schemes have been proposed, in which a
single quantum bit (qubit) is ``encoded'' as a state of some larger number of
qubits, chosen to resist particular types of errors. Most such schemes are
vulnerable, however, to errors in the encoding and decoding itself. We examine
two such schemes, in which a single qubit is encoded in a state of $n$ qubits
while subject to dephasing or to arbitrary isotropic noise. Using both
analytical and numerical calculations, we argue that error correction remains
beneficial in the presence of weak noise, and that there is an optimal time
between error correction steps, determined by the strength of the interaction
with the environment and the parameters set by the encoding.

emission region could be obtained from the HBT interferometry. We also argue
that such a measurement may serve to reject one of the two currently suggested
emission mechanisms, i.e., thermal process versus dynamical Casimir effect.

states in ordinary quantum mechanics. This is done by means of a Hamiltonian
approach to the evolution of the parameters that define the state. The

techniques to the study of the stability of minisuperspace solutions in field
theory. For a $\lambda \varphi^4$ theory we show, both by means of perturbation

homogeneous minisuperspace sector is indeed stable for positive values of the
parameters that define the field theory.

binary linear code with similar error-correcting capabilities, thereby
demonstrating new connections between quantum codes and classical codes. Using
this result -- which applies to degenerate as well as nondegenerate codes --
previously established necessary conditions for classical linear codes can be
easily translated into necessary conditions for quantum stabilizer codes.
Examples of specific consequences are: for a quantum channel subject to a
delta-fraction of errors, the best asymptotic capacity attainable by any
stabilizer code cannot exceed H(1/2 + sqrt(2*delta*(1-2*delta))); and, for the
depolarizing channel with fidelity parameter delta, the best asymptotic
capacity attainable by any stabilizer code cannot exceed 1-H(delta).
