  for su(1,1) Lie algebra","Xiao-Guang Wang","  The ladder operator formalism of a general quantum state for su(1,1) Lie
algebra is obtained. The state bears the generally deformed oscillator
algebraic structure. It is found that the Perelomov's coherent state is a
su(1,1) nonlinear coherent state. The expansion and the exponential form of the
nonlinear coherent state are given. We obtain the matrix elements of the
su(1,1) displacement operator in terms of the hypergeometric functions and the
expansions of the displaced number states and Laguerre polynomial states are
followed. Finally some interesting su(1,1) optical systems are discussed.

m}|\alpha,f>$, we introduce a new type of nonlinear coherent states with
negative values of $m.$ The nonlinear coherent states corresponding to the
positive and negative values of $m$ are shown to be the result of nonunitarily
deforming the number states $|m>$ and $|0>$, respectively. As an example, we
study the sub-Poissonian statistics and squeezing effects of the photon-added
geometric states with negative values of $m$ in detail. Finally we investigate
the photon-added two-photon nonlinear coherent states and find that they are
still the two-photon nonlinear coherent states with certain nonlinear
functions.

"3","Normal Ordering for Deformed Boson Operators and Operator-valued
  Deformed Stirling Numbers","Jacob Katriel|Maurice Kibler","  The normal ordering formulae for powers of the boson number operator
$\hat{n}$ are extended to deformed bosons. It is found that for the `M-type'
deformed bosons, which satisfy $a a^{\dagger} - q a^{\dagger} a = 1$, the
extension involves a set of deformed Stirling numbers which replace the
Stirling numbers occurring in the conventional case. On the other hand, the
deformed Stirling numbers which have to be introduced in the case of the
`P-type' deformed bosons, which satisfy $a a^{\dagger} - q a^{\dagger} a =
q^{-\hat{n}}$, are found to depend on the operator $\hat{n}$. This distinction
between the two types of deformed bosons is in harmony with earlier
observations made in the context of a study of the extended
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula.

the physical processes in a quantum system. We use the density matrix theory as
one of the most powerfool tool for investigation of quantum relaxation. In the
beginning of the work (chapter 2) we mention and recall the most important
steps of derivation of the equation of motion for the reduced density matrix
(master equation) for an arbitrary quantum system in diabatic representation
interacting with the environment modeled by a set of independent harmonic
oscillators. Chapter 3 deals with the question of the border between classical
and quantum effects and reports on a study of the environmental influence on
the time evolution of a coherent state or the superposition of two coherent
states of a harmonic oscillator as a simple system displaying the peculiarities
of the transition from quantum to classical regime. Chapters 4 and 5 concern
the electron transfer (ET) problem, namely the mathematical description of the
ET in molecular zinc-porphyrin-quinone complexes modeling artificial
photosynthesis (chapter 4) and photoinduced processes in the porphyrin triad
(chapter 5). Each chapter starts with an introduction and ends with a brief

a certain limit: completely avoided). By ""substantially decreased"" we mean that
the correlations which involve the bath's states prove negligible, while the
correlations between the qubit's and the environment's states can be made
ineffective during a comparatively long time interval. So, effectively, one may
choose the conditions under which, for sufficiently long time interval, the
initial state of ""qubit + bath"" remains unchanged, thus removing any kind of
the errors. The method has been successfully employed in the (simplified) model

new system of electromagnetic units, based on meter, kilogram, and second,
bearing on these findings. The system has none of the disadvantages of
traditional three-unit systems. On the basis of our theoretical model we can
genuinely derive the scaling factor between electromagnetic and mechanic

two-atom system. We also show that the two-atom Dicke micromaser is equivalent
to a one-atom cascade two-photon micromaser. With the introduction of a
one-photon detuning, the present theory further describes a true two-photon
micromaser. We discuss in detail the role of one-photon detuning in the
mechanism of a one-atom two-photon micromaser. This leads us to point out that
the two-atom cavity dynamics can be verified by a proper scaling of the results

"43","Time dependence of evanescent quantum waves","J. G. Muga|M. Buttiker","  The time dependence of quantum evanescent waves generated by a point source
with an infinite or a limited frequency band is analyzed. The evanescent wave
is characterized by a forerunner (transient) related to the precise way the
source is switched on. It is followed by an asymptotic, monochromatic wave
which at long times reveals the oscillation frequency of the source. For a
source with a sharp onset the forerunner is exponentially larger than the
monochromatic solution and a transition from the transient regime to the
asymtotic regime occurs only at asymptotically large times. In this case, the
traversal time for tunneling plays already a role only in the transient regime.
To enhance the monochromatic solution compared to the forerunner we investigate
(a) frequency band limited sources and (b) the short time Fourier analysis (the
spectrogram) corresponding to a detector which is frequency band limited.
Neither of these two methods leads to a precise determination of the traversal
time. However, if they are limited to determine the traversal time only with a
precision of the traversal time itself both methods are successful: In this
case the transient behavior of the evanescent waves is at a time of the order
of the traversal time followed by a monochromatic wave which reveals the
frequency of the source.

analytically and numerically the behavior of mean values and uncertainties of

of the Q-function and the distribution of excitation quanta of the lattice

describing the physics inside a volume (including gravity) is bounded by the
area of the boundary (also called the screen) which encloses this volume. A
stronger statement is that these (quantum) degrees of freedom live on the
boundary and describe the physics inside the volume completely. The obvious
question is, what mechanism is behind the holographic principle. Recently, 't
Hooft argued that the quantum degrees of freedom on the boundary are not
fundamental. We argue that this interpretation opens up the possibility that
the mapping between the theory in the bulk (the holographic theory) and the
theory on the screen (the dual theory) is always given by a (generalized)
procedure of stochastic quantization. We show that gravity causes differences
to the situation in Minkowski/Euclidean spacetime and argue that the fictitious
coordinate needed in the stochastic quantization procedure can be spatial. The
diffusion coefficient of the stochastic process is in general a function of
this coordinate. While a mapping of a bulk theory onto a (quantum) boundary
theory can be possible, such a mapping does not make sense in spacetimes in
which the area of the screen is growing with time. This is connected to the
average process in the formalism of stochastic quantization. We show where the
stochastic quantization procedure breaks down and argue, in agreement with `t
Hooft, that the quantum degrees of freedom are not fundamental degrees of
freedom. They appear as a limit of a more complex process.

"78","Query Complexity: Worst-Case Quantum Versus Average-Case Classical","Scott Aaronson","  In this note we investigate the relationship between worst-case quantum query
complexity and average-case classical query complexity. Specifically, we show
that if a quantum computer can evaluate a total Boolean function f with bounded
error using T queries in the worst case, then a deterministic classical
computer can evaluate f using O(T^5) queries in the average case, under a
uniform distribution of inputs. If f is monotone, we show furthermore that only
O(T^3) queries are needed. Previously, Beals et al. (1998) showed that if a
quantum computer can evaluate f with bounded error using T queries in the worst
case, then a deterministic classical computer can evaluate f using O(T^6)
queries in the worst case, or O(T^4) if f is monotone. The optimal bound is
conjectured to be O(T^2), but improving on O(T^6) remains an open problem.
Relating worst-case quantum complexity to average-case classical complexity may
suggest new ways to reduce the polynomial gap in the ordinary worst-case versus
worst-case setting.

To justify this one needs relativistic Gamow vectors which in turn define the

the S-matrix pole position s_R. For the Z-boson this means that $M_R \approx

However due to ac-Stark associated quantum noise the signal-to-noise ratio of
EIT-based magnetometers attains a maximum value at a certain laser intensity.
This value is independent on the quantum statistics of the light and defines a

notion that a quantity in such a theory may be analysed into parts and that the
results of this analysis may be treated in languages with an underlying boolean
structure. We shall see that in the course of constructing a model of a theory
with these properties different indistinguishable possibilities will arise for
how the elements of the model may be named, that is to say different
possibilities arise for how they can be associated with points from Set. Taking
a particular collection of possibilities gives the usual boolean lattice of the
propositions of classical physics. Taking all possibilities - in a sense, the
set of all things that may be described by physical theories - gives the
lattice of quantum mechanical propositions. This gives an interpretation of
quantum mechanics as the complete set of such possible descriptions, the

"121","Noncommutative analysis and quantum physics I. Quantities, ensembles and
  states","Arnold Neumaier","  A unified conceptual foundation of classical and quantum physics is given,
free of undefined terms.
  Ensembles are defined by extending the `probability via expectation' approach
of Whittle to noncommuting quantities. This approach carries no connotations of
unlimited repeatability; hence it can be applied to unique systems such as the
universe. Precise concepts and traditional results about complementarity,
uncertainty and nonlocality follow with a minimum of technicalities.
Probabilities are introduced in a generality supporting so-called effects
(i.e., fuzzy events).
  States are defined as partial mappings that provide reference values for
certain quantities. An analysis of sharpness properties yields well-known no-go
theorems for hidden variables. By dropping the sharpness requirement, hidden
variable theories such as Bohmian mechanics can be accommodated, but so-called
ensemble states turn out to be a more natural realization of a realistic state
concept. The weak law of large numbers explains the emergence of classical
properties for macroscopic systems.

behaviour of Schrodinger electron (SchEl) and bring to light on the cause for
the Heisenberg convenient operator way of its describing, using the
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics laws and its mathematical results. We
describe the forced stochastically diverse circular oscillation motion, created
by force of the electrical interaction of the SchEl's elementary electric
charge with the electric intensity of the resultant quantum electromagnetic
field of the existing StchVrtPhtns, as a solution of Abraham-Lorentz equation.
By dint of this equation we obtain that the smooth thin line of a classical
macro particle is rapidly broken of many short and disorderly orientated lines,
owing the continuous dispersion of the quantum micro particle (QntMicrPrt) on
the StchVrtPhtns. Between two successive scattering the centers of diverse
circular oscillations with stochastically various radii are moving along this
short disordered line. These circular oscillations lie within the flats,
perpendicular to same disordered short line, along which are moving its
centers. In a result of same forced circular oscillation motion the smooth thin
line of the LrEl is roughly spread and turned out into some cylindrically wide
path of the SchEl. Hence the dispersions of different dynamical parameters,
determining the state of the SchEl, which are results of its continuously
interaction with the resultant quantum electromagnetic field of the
StchVrtPhtns. The absence of the smooth thin line trajectory at the circular
oscilation moving of the QntMicrPrt forces us to use the matrix elements

This method treats the ""particles"" in the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation as
Lagrangian fluid elements which carry the phase, $S$, and density,
  $\rho$, required to reconstruct the quantum wavefunctions. Here, we compare
results obtained via the MWLS procedure to exact results obtained either

secondly tunneling dynamics in a double well potential. In the case of
tunneling in the double well potential, the quantum potential acts to lower the
barrier separating the right and left hand sides of the well permitting
trajectories to pass from one side to another.
  However, as probability density passes from one side to the other, the
effective barrier begins to rise and eventually will segregate trajectories in
one side from the other. We note that the MWLS trajectories exhibited long time
stability in the purely harmonic cases. However, this stability was not evident
in the barrier crossing dynamics. Comparisons to exact trajectories obtained
via wave packet calculations indicate that the MWLS trajectories tend to
underestimate the effects of constructive and destructive interference effects.

frequency component of the noise, the same devices exhibit squeezing. It is
shown that squeezing and thermal noise can coexist in the multi-mode output
field of laser diodes. This result implies that the squeezed light generated by
regularly pumped semiconductor laser diodes is qualitatively different from
single mode squeezed light. In particular, no entanglement between photons can
be generated using this type of collective multi-mode squeezing.

known to be a fractal function of the so-called electric matching ratio which
is the ratio of the ac field frequency and the Bloch frequency. This paper
studies a manifestation of the fractal spectrum in the system atom in a
standing laser wave, which is a quantum optical realization of a Bloch
electron. It is shown that for an appropriate choice of the system parameters
the atomic survival probability (a quantity measured in laboratory experiments)
develops a fractal structure as a function of the electric matching ratio.
Numerical simulations under classically chaotic scattering conditions show good

correction term W arising from the interaction via the continuum of decay
channels. The eigenvalues E_R of H are complex. They are the poles of the
S-matrix and provide both the energies and widths of the states. We illustrate
the interplay between Re(H) and Im(H) by means of the different interference
phenomena between two neighboured resonance states. Level repulsion along the
real axis appears if the interaction is caused mainly by Re(H) while a
bifurcation of the widths appears if the interaction occurs mainly due to
Im(H). We then calculate the poles of the S-matrix and the corresponding
wavefunctions for a rectangular microwave resonator with a scatter as a
function of the area of the resonator as well as of the degree of opening to a
guide. The calculations are performed by using the method of exterior complex
scaling. Re(W) and Im(W) cause changes in the structure of the wavefunctions
which are permanent, as a rule. At full opening to the lead, short-lived
collective states are formed together with long-lived trapped states. The
wavefunctions of the short-lived states at full opening to the lead are very
different from those at small opening. The resonance picture obtained from the
microwave resonator shows all the characteristic features known from the study
of many-body systems in spite of the absence of two-body forces. The poles of
the S-matrix determine the conductance of the resonator. Effects arising from
the interplay between resonance trapping and level repulsion along the real

distinguishability of the resource's state from its equilibrium state in the
sense of a statistical inference problem. Accordingly, Kullback-Leibler
relative information is a decisive quantity for the `worth' of the resource's

$\MOD_q$ is equivalent to $\MOD_t$ (up to constant depth). Based on the case
$q=2$, Moore \cite{moore99} has shown that quantum analogs of AC$^{(0)}$,
ACC$[q]$, and ACC, denoted QAC$^{(0)}_{wf}$, QACC$[2]$, QACC respectively,
define the same class of operators, leaving $q > 2$ as an open question. Our
result resolves this question, proving that QAC$^{(0)}_{wf} =$ QACC$[q] = $
QACC for all $q$. We also develop techniques for proving upper bounds for QACC
in terms of related language classes. We define classes of languages EQACC,
NQACC and BQACC$_{\rats}$. We define a notion $\log$-planar QACC operators and
show the appropriately restricted versions of EQACC and NQACC are contained in

show the appropriately restricted versions of EQACC and NQACC are contained in
TC$^{(0)}$. To do this last proof, we show that TC$^{(0)}$ can perform iterated
addition and multiplication in certain field extensions. We also introduce the
notion of a polynomial-size tensor graph and show that families of such graphs
can encode the amplitudes resulting from apply an arbitrary QACC operator to an
initial state.

"313","Robust unravelings for resonance fluorescence","H. M. Wiseman|Zoe Brady","  Monitoring the fluorescent radiation of an atom unravels the master equation
evolution by collapsing the atomic state into a pure state which evolves
stochastically. A robust unraveling is one that gives pure states that, on
average, are relatively unaffected by the master equation evolution (which
applies once the monitoring ceases). The ensemble of pure states arising from
the maximally robust unraveling has been suggested to be the most natural way
of representing the system [H.M. Wiseman and J.A. Vaccaro, Phys. Lett. A {\bf
250}, 241 (1998)]. We find that the maximally robust unraveling of a resonantly
driven atom requires an adaptive interferometric measurement proposed by
Wiseman and Toombes [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 60}, 2474 (1999)]. The resultant
ensemble consists of just two pure states which, in the high driving limit, are
close to the eigenstates of the driving Hamiltonian $\Omega\sigma_{x}/2$. This
ensemble is the closest thing to a classical limit for a strongly driven atom.
We also find that it is possible to reasonably approximate this ensemble using
just homodyne detection, an example of a continuous Markovian unraveling. This
has implications for other systems, for which it may be necessary in practice
to consider only continuous Markovian unravelings.

Euclidean transformations (AET), which are equivalent to Euclidean
transformations at space-time infinity, and proposes a formulation of
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics which is invariant under such
transformations. This formulation is based on the asymptotic quantum measure,
which is shown to be invariant under AET's. This invariance exposes an
important connection between AET's and Feynman path integrals, and reveals the
nonmetric character of the asymptotic quantum measure. The latter feature
becomes even clearer when the theory is formulated in terms of the
coordinate-free formalism of asymptotically Euclidean manifold, which do not
have a metric structure. This mathematical formalism suggests the following
physical interpretation: (i) Particles evolution is represented by trajectories
on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold; (ii) The metric and the law of motion
are not defined a priori as fundamental entities, but they are properties of a
particular class of reference frames; (iii) The universe is considered as a
probability space in which the asymptotic quantum measure plays the role of a
probability measure. Points (ii) and (iii) are used to build the asymptotic
measurement theory, which is shown to be consistent with traditional quantum
measurement theory. The most remarkable feature of this measurement theory is
the possibility of having a nonchaotic distribution of the initial conditions

allows to interpret typical quantum phenomena, such as particle diffraction and

technology to produce computers of any useful size. While it is probable that
some of these will be successfully sidestepped during the next few years, it is
unlikely that they will all be solved; thus current liquid state NMR techniques
are unlikely to provide a viable technology for practical quantum computation.

  Symmetric Configurations","Anupam Garg","  The perfect quenching of spin tunneling that has previously been discussed in
terms of interfering instantons, and has recently been observed in the magnetic
molecule \Fe8, is treated using a discrete phase integral (or
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) method. The simplest model Hamiltonian for the
phenomenon leads to a Schr\""odinger equation that is a five-term recursion
relation. This recursion relation is reflection-symmetric when the magnetic
field applied to the molecule is along the hard magnetic axis. A completely
general Herring formula for the tunnel splittings for all reflection-symmetric
five-term recursion relations is obtained. Using connection formulas for a new
type of turning point that may be described as lying ""under the barrier"", and
which underlies the oscillations in the splitting as a function of magnetic
field, this Herring formula is transformed into two other formulas that express
the splittings in terms of a small number of action and action-like integrals.
These latter formulas appear to be generally valid, even for problems where the
recursion contains more than five terms. The results for the model Hamiltonian
are compared with experiment, numerics, previous instanton based approaches,

extended to the case where the magnetic field has both hard and easy

is now inapplicable, so the problem is solved by finding the wavefunction and
using connection formulas at every turning point. A general formula for the

"303","Decoherence and Measurement in Open Quantum Systems","Vladimir Privman|Dima Mozyrsky","  We review results of a recently developed model of a microscopic quantum
system interacting with the macroscopic world components which are modeled by
collections of bosonic modes. The interaction is via a general operator
$\Lambda$ of the system, coupled to the creation and annihilation operators of
the environment modes. We assume that in the process of a nearly instantaneous
quantum measurement, the function of the environment involves two distinct
parts: the pointer and the bath. Interaction of the system with the bath leads
to decoherence such that the system and the pointer both evolve into a
statistical mixture state described by the density matrix such that the system
is in one of the eigenstates of $\Lambda$ with the correct quantum mechanical
probability, whereas the expectation values of pointer operators retain
amplified information on that eigenstate. We argue that this process represents
the initial step of a quantum measurement. Calculation of the elements of the
reduced density matrix of the system and pointer is carried out exactly, and
time dependence of decoherence is identified. We discuss general implications
of our model of energy-conserving coupling to a heat bath for processes of
adiabatic quantum decoherence. We also evaluate changes in the expectation
values of certain pointer operators and suggest that these can be interpreted
as macroscopic indicators of the measurement outcome.

quantum teleportation of continuous electromagnetic field variables introduces
additional noise, limiting the fidelity of the quantum state transfer. In this
article, the operator describing the quantum state transfer is derived. The
transfer operator modifies the probability amplitudes of the quantum state in a
shifted photon number base by enhancing low photon numbers and suppressing high
photon numbers. This modification of the statistical weight corresponds to a
measurement of finite resolution performed on the original quantum state. The
limited fidelity of quantum teleportation is thus shown to be a direct
consequence of the information obtained in the measurement.

and therefore cannot thermalize by themselves. Doppler shifts due to thermal
motions of cavity walls provide necessary mixing, but also preserve the
amplitudes and phases. The lambda/2 intervals of the modes thus preserved must
have equal energy expectations, say <E>, in the resulting equilibrium. By
definition again, they can be exchanged between modes only in whole numbers and
hence only between harmonics. Each family of harmonic modes is thus
self-contained and is disjoint from other families in such exchanges, and
further, can have no more than one mode excited at any instant. The second
property identifies harmonic families of standing wave modes as the harmonic
oscillators of Planck's theory, since a family can only bear energy equal to
exactly one of E, 2E, 3E, etc These two properties further imply that the
energy expectation gets averaged only over an individual family, as the
equilibrium energy <E(f)> steadily available at a given mode would have
contributions from its entire harmonic family. Planck's equations reemerge, and
radiation quantization arises as a classical rule <E(f)> = <E>f, as a mode must
contain a whole number of exchangeable lambda/2 intervals, but it only concerns
equilibrium states. The result makes Planck constant h an analogue of
Boltzmann's constant k for the frequency domain, and points to postulate-free
explanations of all aspects of quantum and kinetic theories.

found that the larger the degree of initial squeezing is, the more rapidly the
squeezed state loses its nonlocality. We explain this by the rapid destruction
of quantum coherence for the strongly squeezed state.

"623","Transfer of nonclassical features in quantum teleportation via a mixed
  quantum channel","Jinhyoung Lee|M. S. Kim|Hyunseok Jeong","  Quantum teleportation of a continuous-variable state is studied for the
quantum channel of a two-mode squeezed vacuum influenced by a thermal
environment. Each mode of the squeezed vacuum is assumed to undergo the same
thermal influence. It is found that when the mixed two-mode squeezed vacuum for
the quantum channel is separable, any nonclassical features, which may be
imposed in an original unknown state, cannot be transferred to a receiving
station. A two-mode Gaussian state, one of which is a mixed two-mode squeezed
vacuum, is separable if and only if a positive well-defined $P$ function can be
assigned to it. The fidelity of teleportation is considered in terms of the
noise factor given by the imperfect channel. It is found that quantum
teleportation may give more noise than direct transmission of a field under the
thermal environment, which is due to the fragile nature of quantum entanglement
of the quantum channel.

to the best of our knowledge, the only one which does not introduce any new

are not used for exactly this purpose, one must then explain why the violation
of the superposition principle which they introduce does not destroy quantum
mechanics. A possible experimental test of the model would be to compare the
coherence lengths for, e.g., electrons and photons in a double-slit experiment.
The electrons should have a finite coherence length, while photons should have

  mechanics","R. W. Spekkens|J. E. Sipe","  Modal interpretations constitute a particular approach to associating
dynamical variables with physical systems in quantum mechanics. Given the
`quantum logical' constraints that are typically adopted by such
interpretations, only certain sets of variables can be taken to be
simultaneously definite-valued, and only certain sets of values can be ascribed
to these variables at a given time. Moreover, each allowable set of variables
and values can be uniquely specified by a single `preferred' projector in the
Hilbert space associated with the system. In general, the preferred projector
can be one of several possibilities at a given time. In previous modal
interpretations, the different possible preferred projectors have formed an
orthogonal set. This paper investigates the consequences of adopting a
non-orthogonal set. We present three contributions on this issue: (1) we
provide an argument for such non-orthogonality, based on the assumption that
perfectly predictable measurements reveal pre-existing values of variables, an
assumption which has traditionally constituted a strong motivation for the
modal approach; (2) we generalize the existing framework for modal
interpretations to accommodate non-orthogonal preferred projectors; (3) we
present a novel type of modal interpretation wherein the set of preferred
projectors is fixed by a principle of entropy minimization, and we discuss some
of the successes and shortcomings of this proposal.

presented which allows the possibility to obtain the generalization of Lifshitz
results for the case of two semi-spaces covered by the thin layers. Additional
clarifications of the regularization procedure provides the means to obtain
reliable results not only for the force but also for the energy density. This,
in turn, leads to the value of the force for the configuration of a sphere
(lens) above a plate both of which are covered by additional layers. The
Casimir interaction between Al and Au test bodies is recalculated using the
optical tabulated data for the complex refractive index of these metals. The
computations turn out to be in agreement with the perturbation theory up to the
fourth order in relative penetration depth of electromagnetic zero point
oscillations into the metal. The disagreements between the results recently
presented in the literature are resolved. The Casimir force between Al bodies
covered by the thin Au layers is computed and the possibility to neglect
spatial dispersion effects is discussed as a function the layer thickness. The
van der Waals force is calculated including the transition region to the
Casimir force. The pure non-retarded van der Waals force law between Al and Au

means of the stress tensor is examined. The evaluation of this quantity is
carried out using an explicit regularization procedure which has its origin in
the underlying (2+1) dimensional Poincar\'{e} invariance of the system. The
force between the planes is found to depend on the ratio of two independent
cutoff parameters, thereby rendering any prediction for the Casimir effect an
explicit function of the particular calculational scheme employed. Similar
results are shown to obtain in the case of the conducting sphere.

"973","Time discretization of functional integrals","J. H. Samson","  Numerical evaluation of functional integrals usually involves a finite
(L-slice) discretization of the imaginary-time axis. In the auxiliary-field
method, the L-slice approximant to the density matrix can be evaluated as a
function of inverse temperature at any finite L as
$\rho_L(\beta)=[\rho_1(\beta/L)]^L$, if the density matrix $\rho_1(\beta)$ in
the static approximation is known. We investigate the convergence of the
partition function $Z_L(\beta)=Tr\rho_L(\beta)$, the internal energy and the
density of states $g_L(E)$ (the inverse Laplace transform of $Z_L$), as
$L\to\infty$. For the simple harmonic oscillator, $g_L(E)$ is a normalized
truncated Fourier series for the exact density of states. When the
auxiliary-field approach is applied to spin systems, approximants to the
density of states and heat capacity can be negative. Approximants to the
density matrix for a spin-1/2 dimer are found in closed form for all L by
appending a self-interaction to the divergent Gaussian integral and
analytically continuing to zero self-interaction. Because of this continuation,
the coefficient of the singlet projector in the approximate density matrix can
be negative. For a spin dimer, $Z_L$ is an even function of the coupling
constant for L<3: ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling can be
distinguished only for $L\ge 3$, where a Berry phase appears in the functional
integral. At any non-zero temperature, the exact partition function is
recovered as $L\to\infty$.

qubits to dissipative interaction with the environment via amplitude damping
channel (ADC). We show that such noisy states result while sharing the states
(| \Phi ^{\pm}> =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(| 00> \pm | 11>)) across ADC. We also show
that under similar dissipative interactions different Bell states give rise to
noisy entangled states that are qualitatively very different from each other in
the sense, only the noisy entangled states constructed from the Bell states (|
\Phi ^{\pm}>) can \emph{}be made better sometimes by subjecting the unaffected
qubit to a dissipative interaction with the environment. Importantly if the
noisy state is non teleporting then it can always be made teleporting with this
prescription. We derive the most general restrictions on improvement of such
noisy states assuming that the damping parameters being different for both the
qubits. However this curious prescription does not work for the noisy entangled
states generated from (| \Psi ^{\pm}> =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(| 01> \pm | 10>)).
This shows that an apriori knowledge of the noisy channel might be helpful to
decide which Bell state needs to be shared between Alice and Bob. \emph{}

and de Matos Filho as dark states of a trapped ion, are extended to NCS on a
circle, for which the Wigner functions are presented. These states are obtained
by applying a suitable displacement operator $D_{h}(\alpha) $ to the vacuum
state. The unity resolutions in terms of the projectors $| \alpha, h> < \alpha,
h^{-1}| ,| \alpha, h^{-1}> < \alpha, h| $ are presented together with a measure
allowing a resolution in terms of $| \alpha, h> < \alpha, h| $. $D_{h}(\alpha)
$ is also used for introducing the probability distribution funtion
$\rho_{A,h}(z) $ while the existence of a measure is exploited for extending
the P-representation to these states. The weight of the n-th Fock state of the
NCS relative to a trapped ion with Lamb-Dicke parameter $\eta ,$ oscillates so
wildly as $n$ grows up to infinity that the normalized NCS fill the open circle
$\eta ^{-1}$ in the complex $\alpha $-plane. In addition this prevents the
existence of a measure including normalizable states only. This difficulty is
overcome by introducing a family of deformations which are rational functions
of n, each of them admitting a measure. By increasing the degree of these
rational approximations the deformation of a trapped ion can be approximated
with any degree of accuracy and the formalism of the P-representation can be
applied.

detect the presence of an opaque object using a test particle without that
particle being absorbed by the object. Here we consider semi-transparent
objects which have an amplitude $\alpha$ of transmitting a particle while
leaving the state of the object unchanged and an amplitude $\beta$ of absorbing
the particle. The task is to devise a protocol that can decide which of two
known transmission amplitudes is present while ensuring that no particle
interacts with the object. We show that the probabilities of being able to
achieve this are limited by an inequality. This inequality implies that
absorption free distinction between complete transparency and any partial
transparency is always possible with probabilities approaching 1, but that two
partial transparencies can only be distinguished with probabilities less than
1.

with instruments. This contact is recordable in files of a Classical Digital
Process-control Computer (CPC) used both to calculate with the equations and to
manage the instruments. By noticing that equations and instruments make contact
in a CPC, we rewrite equations of quantum mechanics to explicitly include
functions of CPC-commands to the instruments. This sets up a proof that a
scientist's choice in linking mathematical models to instruments is
unresolvable without guesswork to narrow the set of models from which one is to
be chosen.
  As for implications of the proof, scientists inherit choices from the past
and frame choices for the future, choices open to guesswork and visible in CPC
files. To picture these choices, we adapt colored Petri nets, and the
availability of these net fragments makes choice and guesswork part and parcel

  Net fragments as a means of expressing guess-demanding choices are applied to
portray guesswork needed in testing and calibrating a quantum computer. The

  interaction","Marco Frasca","  A formulation of quantum electrodynamics is given that applies to atoms in a
strong laser field by perturbation theory in a non-relativistic regime. Dipole
approximation is assumed. The dual Dyson series, here discussed by referring it
to the Birkhoff theorem for singularly perturbed linear differential equations,
can be applied and a perturbation series obtained transforming the Hamiltonian
by a Pauli-Fierz transformation. But, if just few photons are present
high-order harmonics cannot be generated. So, it is proven that odd high-order
harmonics only appear when the laser field is intense and one can substitute
the creation and annihilation operators by the square root of the mean number
of photons taken to be huge, the field retaining its coherency property as
observed experimentally for harmonics. In this case, the Hamiltonian for
perturbation theory comes to the Kramers-Henneberger form. The theory has a
dipolar contribution when the free-electron quiver motion amplitude is larger
than the atomic radius. For a Coulomb potential one has that the outer electron
is periodically kicked, and so a prove is given that the same should happen to
Rydberg atoms in intense microwave fields. The distribution representing the
kicking has a Fourier series with just odd terms. Using a modified
Rayleigh-Schr\""odinger perturbation theory, it is shown that under the same
condition of validity of the quiver motion amplitude to atomic radius ratio,
the atomic wave function is only slightly modified by the laser field due to
the way the energy levels rearrange themselves. This gives a prove of
stabilization in the limit of laser frequency going to infinity. Then,
perturbation theory can be applied when the Keldysh parameter becomes smaller
with respect to the shifted distance between the energy levels of the atom.

restored with accuracy $\epsilon$ from its rough approximation in within

of system with sparse spectrum up to time $T=\frac{1-\rho}{14\epsilon}$ can be
predicted with fidelity $\rho$ on quantum computer in time
$t=\frac{4}{(1-\rho)\epsilon_1}$ plus the time of classical algorithm. The
quantum knowledge of Hamiltonian $H$ eigenvalues is considered as a wizard
Hamiltonian $W_H$ which action on any eigenvector of $H$ gives the
corresponding eigenvalue. Speedup of evolution for systems with sparse spectrum
is possible because for such systems wizard Hamiltonians can be quickly
simulated on a quantum computer. This simulation, generalizing Shor trick, is a
part of presented algorithm.
  In general case the action of wizard Hamiltonian cannot be simulated in time
smaller than the dimension of main space which is exponential of the size of
quantum system. For an arbitrary system (even for classical) its behavior
cannot be predicted on quantum computer even for one step ahead. This method
can be used also for restoration of a state of an arbitrary primary system in
time instant $-T$ in the past with the same fidelity which requires the same

the Stratonovich-Weyl postulates. In analogy to this approach, a discrete Moyal

that appropriately modified postulates single out a well-defined set of kernels
which give rise to discrete symbols. Now operators are represented by functions
taking values on (2s+1)(2s+1) points of the sphere. The discrete symbols
contain no redundant information, contrary to the continuous ones. The

dynamical geometry of a free particle for the cone dynamical geometry without
distorting the free (geodesic) character of the motion, and in the limit of
zero charge's mass it describes a spin system. This observation allows us to
interpret the charge-monopole system alternatively as a free particle of fixed
spin with translational and spin degrees of freedom interacting via the
helicity constraint, or as a symmetric spinning top with dynamical moment of
inertia and ""isospin"" U(1) gauge symmetry, or as a system with higher
derivatives. The last interpretation is used to get the twistor formulation of
the system. We show that the reparametrization and scale invariant monopole
Chern-Simons term supplied with the kinetic term of the same invariance gives
rise to the alternative description for the spin, which is related to the
charge-monopole system in a spherical geometry. The relationship between the
charge-monopole system and (2+1)-dimensional anyon is discussed in the light of

  Liquid-State NMR Spectroscopy","Yehuda Sharf|David G. Cory|Shyamal S. Somaroo|Timothy F. Havel|Emanuel Knill|Raymond Laflamme","  Quantum error correcting codes enable the information contained in a quantum
state to be protected from decoherence due to external perturbations. Applied
to NMR, quantum coding does not alter normal relaxation, but rather converts
the state of a ``data'' spin into multiple quantum coherences involving
additional ancilla spins. These multiple quantum coherences relax at differing
rates, thus permitting the original state of the data to be approximately
reconstructed by mixing them together in an appropriate fashion. This paper
describes the operation of a simple, three-bit quantum code in the product
operator formalism, and uses geometric algebra methods to obtain the
error-corrected decay curve in the presence of arbitrary correlations in the
external random fields. These predictions are confirmed in both the totally
correlated and uncorrelated cases by liquid-state NMR experiments on
13C-labeled alanine, using gradient-diffusion methods to implement these
idealized decoherence models. Quantum error correction in weakly polarized
systems requires that the ancilla spins be prepared in a pseudo-pure state
relative to the data spin, which entails a loss of signal that exceeds any
potential gain through error correction. Nevertheless, this study shows that
quantum coding can be used to validate theoretical decoherence mechanisms, and
to provide detailed information on correlations in the underlying NMR
relaxation dynamics.

detailed example is given of a quantum code for protecting two data qubits from
evolution under a weak coupling (Ising) term in the Hamiltonian, using an
``isolated'' ancilla which does not evolve on the experimental time scale. The
code is realized in a three-spin system by liquid-state NMR spectroscopy on
13C-labelled alanine, and tested for two initial states. It is also shown that
for coherent evolution and isolated ancillae, codes exist that do not require
the ancillae to initially be in a (pseudo-)pure state. Finally, it is shown
that even with non-isolated ancillae quantum codes exist which can protect
against evolution under weak coupling. An example is presented for a six qubit
code that protects two data spins to first order.

various contexts. The question arises whether such effects could be observed
with extremely weak pulses, and what would prevent the observation of an
""optical tachyon."" Aharonov, Reznik, and Stern (ARS) [Phys. Rev. Lett., vol.
81, 2190 (1998)] have argued that quantum noise will preclude the observation
of a superluminal group velocity when the pulse consists of one or a few
photons. In this paper we reconsider this question both in a general framework
and in the specific example, suggested by Chiao, Kozhekin, and Kurizki [Phys.
Rev. Lett., vol. 77, 1254 (1996)], of off-resonant, short-pulse propagation in
an optical amplifier. We derive in the case of the amplifier a signal-to-noise
ratio that is consistent with the general ARS conclusions when we impose their
criteria for distinguishing between superluminal propagation and propagation at
the speed c. However, results consistent with the semiclassical arguments of
CKK are obtained if weaker criteria are imposed, in which case the signal can
exceed the noise without being ""exponentially large."" We show that the quantum
fluctuations of the field considered by ARS are closely related to
superfluorescence noise. More generally we consider the implications of
unitarity for superluminal propagation and quantum noise and study, in addition
to the complete and truncated wavepackets considered by ARS, the residual
wavepacket formed by their difference. This leads to the conclusion that the
noise is mostly luminal and delayed with respect to the superluminal signal. In
the limit of a very weak incident signal pulse, the superluminal signal will be
dominated by the noise part, and the signal-to-noise ratio will therefore be
very small.

pulses in the Kerr medium is developed with taking into account the response
time of an electronic nonlinearity. The correspondent algebra of time-dependent
Bose-operators is elaborated. It is established that the spectral region of the
pulse, where the quadrature fluctuations level is lower than the shot-noise
one, depends on the value of the nonlinear phase shift, the intensity of
another pulse, and the relaxation time of the nonlinearity. It is shown that
the frequency of the pulse spectrum at which the suppression of fluctuations is

continuous dynamical evolution of the state vector for a macroscopic object.
Our main concern is to recover the decoupling of the state vector dynamics for
the center-of-mass (CM) and internal motion, as in the GRWP model, but within
the framework of the standard cosmology. In this connection we have taken the
opposite direction of the GRWP argument, that the cosmic background radiation
(CBR) has originated from a fundamental stochastic hitting process. We assume
the CBR as a clue of the Big Bang, playing a main role in the decoupling of the
state vector dynamics of the CM and internal motion. In our model, instead of
describing a continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) of a system of massive
particles as proposed by Ghirardi, Pearle and Rimini, the It\^{o} stochastic
equation accounts for the intervention of the CBR on the system of particles.
Essentially, this approach leads to a pre-master equation for both the CBR and
particles degrees of freedom. The violation of the principle of energy
conservation characteristic of the CSL model is avoided as well as the
additional assumption on the size of the GRWP's localization width necessary to
reach the decoupling between the collective and internal motions. Moreover,
realistic estimation for the decoherence time, exhibiting an interesting
dependence on the CBR temperature, is obtained. From the formula for the
decoherence time it is possible to analyze the transition from micro to macro
dynamics in both the early hot Universe and the nowadays cold one. The entropy
of the system under decoherence is analyzed and the emergent `pointer basis' is
discussed. In spite of not having imposed a privileged basis, in our model the
position still emerges as the preferred observable as in the CSL model.

interactions. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of
decoherence-free (noiseless) subsystems in the Markovian regime is derived here
for the first time. A stabilizer formalism for DFSs is then developed which
allows for the explicit understanding of these in their dual role as quantum
error correcting codes. Conditions for the existence of Hamiltonians whose
induced evolution always preserves a DFS are derived within this stabilizer
formalism. Two possible collective decoherence mechanisms arising from
permutation symmetries of the system-bath coupling are examined within this
framework. It is shown that in both cases universal quantum computation which
always preserves the DFS (*natural fault-tolerant computation*) can be
performed using only two-body interactions. This is in marked contrast to
standard error correcting codes, where all known constructions using one or
two-body interactions must leave the codespace during the on-time of the
fault-tolerant gates. A further consequence of our universality construction is
that a single exchange Hamiltonian can be used to perform universal quantum
computation on an encoded space whose asymptotic coding efficiency is unity.
The exchange Hamiltonian, which is naturally present in many quantum systems,
is thus *asymptotically universal*.

contains a critique of this usual point of view: firstly, by emphazising an
gauge theoretic conventionalism which crucially restricts the conceptual role
of the gauge principle and, secondly, by introducing a new generalized
equivalence principle - the identity of inertial and field charge (as
generalizations of inertial and gravitational mass) - in order to give a
conceptual justification for combining the equations of motion of the

degeneracy of the valence band is lifted by the combination of strain and a
static magnetic field. We give a detailed description of a semiconductor
structure that transfers photon polarization to electron spin coherently, and
allows electron spins to be stored and to be made available for quantum
information processing.

interaction operator have negative as well as positive eigenvalues, limited in
magnitude to the Planck energy. Interactions in one-center particles between
spinors with eigenvalues of different sign tend to bring the energy of the

  At the origin of the energy reduction through interaction is the spin

Carlo wave-function simulations of the system dynamics show that, for a
suitably chosen cavity detuning, it is possible to generate states of photon

nonclassical correlations of the type described by Greenberger, Horne, and
Zeilinger (GHZ). An experimental scheme to realize a GHZ measurement using
coincidence detection of the photons escaping from the cavity is proposed. The
correlations are found to originate in the dynamics of the adiabatic passage

  Biochemical Thermodynamics","Clinton D. Stoner","  Free energy and entropy are examined in detail from the standpoint of
classical thermodynamics. The approach is logically based on the fact that
thermodynamic work is mediated by thermal energy through the tendency for
nonthermal energy to convert spontaneously into thermal energy and for thermal
energy to distribute spontaneously and uniformly within the accessible space.
The fact that free energy is a Second-Law, expendable energy that makes it
possible for thermodynamic work to be done at finite rates is emphasized.
Entropy, as originally defined, is pointed out to be the capacity factor for
thermal energy that is hidden with respect to temperature; it serves to
evaluate the practical quality of thermal energy and to account for changes in
the amounts of latent thermal energies in systems maintained at constant
temperature. A major objective was to clarify the means by which free energy is
transferred and conserved in sequences of biological reactions coupled by
freely diffusible intermediates. In achieving this objective it was found
necessary to distinguish between a 'characteristic free energy' possessed by
all First-Law energies in amounts equivalent to the amounts of the energies
themselves and a 'free energy of concentration' that is intrinsically
mechanical and relatively elusive in that it can appear to be free of First-Law
energy. The findings in this regard serve to clarify the fact that the transfer
of chemical potential energy from one repository to another along sequences of
biological reactions of the above sort occurs through transfer of the First-Law
energy as thermal energy and transfer of the Second-Law energy as free energy
of concentration.

integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the
quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter

multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics,
perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and
instantons via path integrals.

decoherence times between different fluxoid states of a SQUID by using
``adiabatic inversion'', where one macroscopic fluxoid state is smoothly
transferred into the other, like a spin reversing direction by following a
slowly moving magnetic field. This is accomplished by sweeping an external
applied flux, and depends on a well-defined quantum phase between the two
macroscopic states. Varying the speed of the sweep relative to the decoherence
time permits one to move from the quantum regime, where such a well-defined
phase exists, to the classical regime where it is lost and the inversion is
inhibited. Thus observing whether inversion has taken place or not as a
function of sweep speed offers the possibility of measuring the decoherence
time. The main requirement for the feasibility of the scheme appears to be that
the low temperature relaxation time among the quantum levels of the SQUID be
long compared to other time scales of the problem.

condition, or equivalent, all derivations make an identical mathematical
assumption: that local hidden-variable theories produce a set of
positive-definite probabilities for detecting a particle with a given spin
orientation. The standard argument is that because quantum mechanics assumes
that particles are emitted in a superposition of states the theory cannot
produce such a set of probabilities. We examine a paper by Eberhard, and
several similar papers, which claim to show that a generalized Bell inequality,
the CHSH inequality, can be derived solely on the basis of the locality
condition, without recourse to hidden variables. We point out that these
authors nonetheless assumes a set of positive-definite probabilities, which
supports the claim that hidden variables or ""locality"" is not at issue here,
positive-definite probabilities are. We demonstrate that quantum mechanics does
predict a set of probabilities that violate the CHSH inequality; however these
probabilities are not positive-definite. Nevertheless, they are physically
meaningful in that they give the usual quantum-mechanical predictions in
physical situations. We discuss in what sense our results are related to the
Wigner distribution.

Consequently, the analysis of MKC is incomplete. To make it complete one needs

the limit where the fluctuations and couplings are small compared to one-qubit
energy spacing the spectrum has a band structure and a renormalized Hamiltonian
is obtained which describes the eigenstate properties inside one band. The
studies are concentrated on the central band of the computer (``core'') with
the highest density of states. We show that above a critical inter-qubit
coupling strength, quantum chaos sets in, leading to quantum ergodicity of the
computer eigenstates. In this regime the ideal qubit structure disappears, the
eigenstates become complex and the operability of the computer is quickly
destroyed. We confirm that the quantum chaos border decreases only linearly
with the number of qubits n, although the spacing between multi-qubit states
drops exponentially with n. The investigation of time-evolution in the quantum
computer shows that in the quantum chaos regime, an ideal (noninteracting)
state quickly disappears and exponentially many states become mixed after a
short chaotic time scale for which the dependence on system parameters is
determined. Below the quantum chaos border an ideal state can survive for long
times and be used for computation. The results show that a broad parameter

aimed at an existing model in the literature but rather at a hybrid that
replaces the superposed protein conformations of the `Orch OR' theory with a
soliton in superposition along the microtubule, 2) Tegmark predicts decreasing
decoherence times at lower temperature, in direct contradiction of the observed
behavior of quantum states, 3) recalculation after correcting Tegmark's
equation for differences between his model and the `Orch OR' model

the decoherence time to $10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ s and invalidates a critical
assumption of Tegmark's derivation, 4) incoherent metabolic energy supplied to
the collective dynamics ordering water in the vicinity of microtubules at a
rate exceeding that of decoherence can counter decoherence effects (in the same
way that lasers avoid decoherence at room temperature), and 5) phases of actin
gelation may enhance the ordering of water around microtubule bundles, further
increasing the decoherence-free zone by an order of magnitude and the

  Interferences","H. A. Kastrup","  Following a recent group theoretical quantization of the symplectic space
S={(phi in R mod 2pi, p>0)} in terms of irreducible unitary representations of
the group SO(1,2) the present paper proposes an application of those results to
the old problem of quantizing modulus and phase in interference phenomena: The
self-adjoint Lie algebra generators K_1, K_2 and K_3 of that group correspond
to the classical observables p cos(phi), -p sin(phi) and p > 0 the Poisson
brackets of which obey that Lie algebra, too. For the irreducible unitary
representations of the positive series the modulus operator K_3 has the
positive discrete spectrum {n+k, n=0,1,2,...; k > 0}. Self-adjoint operators
for cos(phi) and sin(phi) can then be defined as (K_3^{-1}K_1 + K_1 K_3^{-1})/2
and - (K_3^{-1} K_2 + K_2 K_3^{-1})/2 which have the theoretically desired
properties for k >0.32. Some matrix elements with respect to number eigenstates
and with respect to coherent states are calculated. One conclusion is that
group theoretical quantization may be tested by quantum optical experiments.

"176","Linking Classical and Quantum Key Agreement: Is There ""Bound
  Information""?","N. Gisin|S. Wolf","  After carrying out a protocol for quantum key agreement over a noisy quantum
channel, the parties Alice and Bob must process the raw key in order to end up
with identical keys about which the adversary has virtually no information. In
principle, both classical and quantum protocols can be used for this
processing. It is a natural question which type of protocols is more powerful.
We prove for general states but under the assumption of incoherent
eavesdropping that Alice and Bob share some so-called intrinsic information in
their classical random variables, resulting from optimal measurements, if and
only if the parties' quantum systems are entangled. In addition, we provide
evidence that the potentials of classical and of quantum protocols are equal in
every situation. Consequently, many techniques and results from quantum
information theory directly apply to problems in classical information theory,
and vice versa. For instance, it was previously believed that two parties can
carry out unconditionally secure key agreement as long as they share some
intrinsic information in the adversary's view. The analysis of this purely
classical problem from the quantum information-theoretic viewpoint shows that
this is true in the binary case, but false in general. More explicitly, bound
entanglement, i.e., entanglement that cannot be purified by any quantum
protocol, has a classical counterpart. This ""bound intrinsic information""
cannot be distilled to a secret key by any classical protocol. As another

information-theoretic quantities.

strength between laser field and ionic core changes. We find around Z=12
typical multiphoton dynamics and for Z=3 tunneling behaviour, however with
clear relativistic signatures. In first order in v/c the magnetic field
component of the laser field induces a Z-dependent drift in the laser
propagation direction and a substantial Z-dependent angular momentum with
repect to the ionic core. While spin oscillations occur already in first order
in v/c as described by the Pauli equation, spin induced forces via spin orbit
coupling only appear in the parameter regime where (v/c)^2 corrections are
significant. In this regime for Z=12 ions we show strong splittings of resonant
spectral lines due to spin-orbit coupling and substantial corrections to the
conventional Stark shift due to the relativistic mass shift while those to the
Darwin term are shown to be small. For smaller charges or higher laser
intensities, parts of the electronic wavepacket may tunnel through the

otherwise. Consider also a quantum algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $A
|0\rangle= \sum_{x\in X} \alpha_x |x\rangle$ is a quantum superposition of the
elements of $X$, and let $a$ denote the probability that a good element is
produced if $A |0\rangle$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running $A$,
measuring the output, and using $\chi$ to check the validity of the result, we
shall expect to repeat $1/a$ times on the average before a solution is found.
*Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good $x$ after an
expected number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{a}$, assuming algorithm $A$ makes no measurements. This is a
generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which $A$ was restricted to
producing an equal superposition of all members of $X$ and we had a promise
that a single $x$ existed such that $\chi(x)=1$. Our algorithm works whether or
not the value of $a$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of $a$ is known,
we can find a good $x$ after a number of applications of $A$ and its inverse
which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$ even in the worst case. We show that this
quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems
for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we
combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude
estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of $a$. We apply
amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish
to estimate the number of $x\in X$ such that $\chi(x)=1$. We obtain optimal
quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.

free relativistic quantum field is considered. In contrast to the
non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the teleportation of an unknown state of
the quantum field cannot be in principle described in terms of a measurement in
a tensor product of two Hilbert spaces to which the unknown state and the state
of the EPR-pair belong. The reason is of the existence of a cyclic (vacuum)
state common to both the unknown state and the EPR-pair. Due to the common
vacuum vector and the microcausality principle (commutation relations for the
field operators), the teleportation amplitude contains inevitably contributions
which are irrelevant to the teleportation process. Hence in the relativistic
theory the teleportation in the sense it is understood in the non-relativistic
quantum mechanics proves to be impossible because of the impossibility of the
realization of the appropriate measurement as a tensor product of the
measurements related to the individual subsystems so that one can only speak of
the amplitude of the propagation of the field as a whole.

that the teleportation as it is understood in the non-relativistic quantum
mechanics is impossible if no {\it a priori} information on the state to be
teleported is available. It is only possible to speak of the amplitude of the
propagation of the field (taking into account the measurement procedure) since
the existence of a common vacuum state together with the microcausality
principle (the field operators commutation relations) make the concept of the
propagation amplitude for the individual subsystems physically meaningless.
When partial {\it a priori} information is available (for example, only the
polarization state of the photon is unknown while its spatial state is
specified beforehand), the teleportation does become possible in the
relativistic case. In that case the {\it a priori} information can be used to
``label'' the identical particles to make them effectively distinguishable.

interference effects from those due to nonequilibrium velocity distribution are
determined. In the case of large Doppler broadening the correction for atomic
motion is equivalent to the substitution of an ""effective immobile atom"" for
the moving atom ensemble. The spectral manifestation of nonlinear effects is

calculated directly from local quantities which preserve the phase information
in the quantum system. We assume strict locality for the probability amplitudes
instead of local realism for the outcomes, and calculate an amplitude
correlation function.Then the experimentally observed correlation of outcomes
is calculated from the square of the amplitude correlation function. Locality
of amplitudes implies that the measurement on one particle does not collapse
the companion particle to a definite state. Apart from resolving the EPR
puzzle, this approach shows that the physical interpretation of apparently
`nonlocal' effects like quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping are
different from what is usually assumed. Bell type measurements do not change
distant states. Yet the correlations are correctly reproduced, when measured,
if complex probability amplitudes are treated as the basic local quantities. As

dust ball from an initial density profile which is physically reasonable. We
show that explosive radiation is emitted during the formation process of the
naked singularity. The energy flux is proportional to $(t_{\rm CH}-t)^{-3/2}$
for a minimally coupled massless scalar field, while is proportional to
$(t_{\rm CH}-t)^{-1}$ for a conformally coupled massless scalar field, where
$t_{\rm CH}-t$ is the `remained time' until the distant observer could observe
the singularity if the naked singularity was formed. As a consequence, the
radiated energy grows unboundedly for both scalar fields. The amount of the
power and the energy depends on parameters which characterize the initial
density profile but do not depend on the gravitational mass of the cloud. In
particular, there is characteristic frequency $\nu_{s}$ of singularity above
which the divergent energy is radiated. The energy flux is dominated by
particles of which the wave length is about $t_{\rm CH}-t$ at each moment. The
observed total spectrum is nonthermal, i.e., $\nu dN/d\nu \sim
(\nu/\nu_{s})^{-1}$ for $\nu>\nu_{s}$. If the naked singularity formation could
continue until a considerable fraction of the total energy of the dust cloud is
radiated, the radiated energy would reach about $10^{54}(M/M_{\odot})$ erg. The
calculations are based on the geometrical optics approximation which turns out
to be consistent as a rough order estimate. The analysis does not depend on
whether or not the naked singularity occurs in its exact meaning. This
phenomenon may provide a new candidate for a source of ultra high energy cosmic
rays or a central engine of gamma ray bursts.

that these states cannot be used to transmit more classical bits than the

have a very simple structure---they involve little interaction between the
communicating parties. We look more closely at the ways in which information
encoded in quantum states may be manipulated, and consider the question as to
whether every classical protocol may be transformed to a ``simpler'' quantum
protocol of similar efficiency. By a simpler protocol, we mean a protocol that
uses fewer message exchanges. We show that for any constant k, there is a
problem such that its k+1 message classical communication complexity is
exponentially smaller than its k message quantum communication complexity, thus
answering the above question in the negative. Our result builds on two
primitives, local transitions in bi-partite states (based on previous work) and
average encoding which may be of significance in other applications as well.

problem of finding appropriate ways of thinking about the spatial and temporal

doctrine of local realism, the principle of local causality, and the
mathematical physicist's golden calf, determinism. The said problem is made
intractable by our obtruding onto the physical world a theoretical framework
that is more detailed than the physical world. This framework portraits space
and time as infinitely and intrinsically differentiated, whereas the physical
world is only finitely differentiated spacewise and timewise, namely to the
extent that spatiotemporal relations and distinctions are warranted by facts.
This has the following consequences: (i) The contingent properties of the
physical world, including the times at which they are possessed, are indefinite
and extrinsic. (ii) We cannot think of reality as being built ""from the bottom
up"", out of locally instantiated physical properties. Instead we must conceive
of the physical world as being built ""from the top down"": By entering into a

the aspect of a spatially differentiated world and the aspect of a multiplicity
of formless relata, the fundamental particles. At the root of our

which the world's synchronic multiplicity is founded on the introduction of
surfaces that carve up space in the manner of three-dimensional cookie cutters.

alone suffices to exactly implement any quantum computer circuit, at a price of
a factor of three in additional qubits and about a factor of ten in additional

large-scale homogeneity of the Universe. The previous attempts to get around
this obstacle led to imposing severe observational constraints on the
parameters of the fields involved. Our aim is to show that yet another way to
overcome the above problem is accounting for EPR effect. Namely, if the scalar
(Higgs) field was presented by a single quantum state at the initial instant of
time, then its reduction during a phase transition at some later instant should
be correlated even at distances exceeding the local cosmological horizon. By
considering a simplest 1D model with Z_2 Higgs field, we demonstrate that EPR
effect really can substantially reduce the probability of spontaneous creation
of the domain walls.

"207","Remarks on Shannon's Statistical Inference and the Second Law in Quantum
  Statistical Mechanics","Kazuo Fujikawa","  We comment on a formulation of quantum statistical mechanics, which
incorporates the statistical inference of Shannon.
  Our basic idea is to distinguish the dynamical entropy of von Neumann, $H =
-k Tr \hat{\rho}\ln\hat{\rho}$, in terms of the density matrix $\hat{\rho}(t)$,
and the statistical amount of uncertainty of Shannon, $S= -k \sum_{n}p_{n}\ln
p_{n}$, with $p_{n}=< n|\hat{\rho}|n>$ in the representation where the total
energy and particle numbers are diagonal. These quantities satisfy the
inequality $S\geq H$. We propose to interprete Shannon's statistical inference
as specifying the {\em initial conditions} of the system in terms of $p_{n}$. A
definition of macroscopic observables which are characterized by intrinsic time
scales is given, and a quantum mechanical condition on the system, which
ensures equilibrium, is discussed on the basis of time averaging.
  An interesting analogy of the change of entroy with the running coupling in
renormalization group is noted. A salient feature of our approach is that the
distinction between statistical aspects and dynamical aspects of quantum
statistical mechanics is very transparent.

distilled. In this paper we evaluate a particular standard form, the {\it
Schmidt form}, which is a generalization of the Schmidt decomposition for
bipartite pure states. We show how the coefficients in this case can be
parametrized in terms of five physically meaningful local invariants; we use
this form to prove the efficacy of a particular distillation technique for GHZ

entanglement properties, showing that these states represent extremes of
distillability as functions of two local invariants.

on the analysis of the reduced action. A consequence of this approach is that
the quantum potential is always non-trivial even in the case of the free

origin of fundamental interactions. We pursue this idea, by making a

sub-system (``the system'') to control the evolution of a second sub-system
(``the ancilla'') which is reversibly coupled to the system. In the limit where
the ancilla responds to fluctuations on a much shorter time scale than does the
system, we show that it can be adiabatically eliminated, yielding a master
equation for the system alone. This is very significant as it decreases the
necessary basis size for numerical simulation and allows the effect of the
ancilla to be understood more easily. We consider two types of ancilla: a
two-level ancilla (e.g. a two-level atom) and an infinite-level ancilla (e.g.
an optical mode). For each, we consider two forms of feedback: coherent (for
which a quantum mechanical description of the feedback loop is required) and
incoherent (for which a classical description is sufficient). We test the
master equations we obtain using numerical simulation of the full dynamics of
the compound system. For the system (a parametric oscillator) and feedback
(intensity-dependent detuning) we choose, good agreement is found in the limit
of heavy damping of the ancilla. We discuss the relation of our work to
previous work on feedback in compound quantum systems, and also to previous
work on adiabatic elimination in general.

at the origin. It is shown that this relation can be translated into a
linearity requirement for electromagnetic fields between the two polarizers.
Along these lines we compute the correlation integral with an expression
conserving linearity. This expression, as shown, correctly describes the
measured values. It seems thus that quantum nonlocality can be seen as a
combination of boundary conditions on possible electromagnetic fields between
the polarizers and a relation of the electromagnetic fields of the two photons
via a phase. We expect the same feature to arise in every experiment, where

depth for computing an approximation of the QFT with respect to the modulus 2^n
with error bounded by epsilon. Thus, even for exponentially small error, our
circuits have depth O(log n). The best previous depth bound was O(n), even for
approximations with constant error. Moreover, our circuits have size O(n log
(n/epsilon)). We also give an upper bound of O(n (log n)^2 log log n) on the
circuit size of the exact QFT modulo 2^n, for which the best previous bound was
O(n^2).
  As an application of the above depth bound, we show that Shor's factoring
algorithm may be based on quantum circuits with depth only O(log n) and
polynomial-size, in combination with classical polynomial-time pre- and
post-processing. In the language of computational complexity, this implies that
factoring is in the complexity class ZPP^BQNC, where BQNC is the class of
problems computable with bounded-error probability by quantum circuits with
poly-logarithmic depth and polynomial size.
  Finally, we prove an Omega(log n) lower bound on the depth complexity of

optical resonators by the mechanical forces associated with single photons
[Hood et al., Science 287, 1447 (2000) and Pinkse et al., Nature 404, 365
(2000)]. Here we analyze the trapping dynamics in these settings, focusing on
two points of interest. Firstly, we investigate the extent to which
light-induced forces in these experiments are distinct from their free-space
counterparts. Secondly, we explore the quantitative features of the resulting
atomic motion and how these dynamics are mapped onto variations of the
intracavity field. Not surprisingly, qualitatively distinct atomic dynamics
arise as the coupling and dissipative rates are varied. For the experiment of
Hood et al., we show that atomic motion is largely conservative and is
predominantly in radial orbits transverse to the cavity axis. A comparison with
the free-space theory demonstrates that the fluctuations of the dipole force
are suppressed by an order of magnitude. This effect is based upon the
Jaynes-Cummings eigenstates of the atom-cavity system and represents
qualitatively new physics for optical forces at the single-photon level. By
contrast, even in a regime of strong coupling in the experiment of Pinkse et
al., there are only small quantitative distinctions between the free-space
theory and the quantum theory, so it is not clear that description of this
experiment as a novel single-quantum trapping effect is necessary. The atomic
motion is strongly diffusive, leading to an average localization time
comparable to the time for an atom to transit freely through the cavity and to
a reduction in the ability to infer aspects of the atomic motion from the
intracavity photon number.

measurement devices may fluctuate from run to run of an experiment. These
fluctuations of frequencies for micro-parameters need not contradict to the
stabilization of frequencies for physical observables. If, nevertheless,
micro-parameters are also statistically stable, then violations of Bell's
inequality and its generalizations may be a consequence of dependence of
collectives corresponding to two different measurement devices. Such a
dependence implies the violation of the factorization rule for the simultaneous
probability distribution. Formally this rule coincides with the well known BCHS
locality condition (or outcome independence condition). However, the frequency
approach implies totally different interpretation of dependence. It is not
dependence of events, but it is dependence of collectives. Such a dependence
may be induced by the same preparation procedure.

Introducing scalar and vector potentials, the formalism is extended in order to
include in the theory the interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field

multipolar-coupling scheme are considered. The theory replaces the standard
concept of mode decomposition which fails for complex permittivities. It

restriction to a particular interaction regime in a particular frequency range.
All relevant information about the dielectric bodies such as form and intrinsic

  field states","N. G. de Almeida|P. B. Ramos|R. M. Serra|M. H. Y. Moussa","  In this work we propose an approach to deal with radiation field states which
incorporates damping effects at zero temperature. By using some well known
results on dissipation of a cavity field state, obtained by standard ab-initio
methods, it was possible to infer through a phenomenological way the explicit
form for the evolution of the state vector for the whole system: the
cavity-field plus reservoir. This proposal turns out to be of extreme
convenience to account for the influence of the reservoir over the cavity
field.
  To illustrate the universal applicability of our approach we consider the
attenuation effects on cavity-field states engineering. A proposal to maximize
the fidelity of the process is presented.

special future final boundary condition for the universe. Although this is an
extension of the way boundary conditions are usually chosen (in terrestrial
laboratories), it is our only deviation from standard quantum mechanics. Using
two state vectors, or the ""two-state"", to describe completely the state of
systems of interest, we analyze ideal and ""weak"" measurements, and show the
consistency of our scheme. If the final state of a measuring device is assigned
to be one of the possible outcomes of the measurement, an effective reduction
is observed after an ideal measurement process. For final conditions chosen
with an appropriate distribution, the predictions of standard quantum mechanics
may be reconstructed, thus eliminating probability from the description of any
single measurement. The interpretation attained, the Teleological
Interpretation, is an ontological one; it is local and deterministic. Other
special assumptions in the choice of the final boundary condition may explain
certain unaccounted for phenomena, or even supply a mechanism for essential
free will. In this context we believe that a new conception of time should be
adopted.

With this observation and some analysis, 't Hooft's theory is generalized

eigenstates and drops only linearly with the number of qubits n. As a result
the ideal multi-qubit structure of the computer remains rather robust against

the physical interactions. It introduces a new kind of representation where the
propagation of massive (invariant mass) and massless interactions are unifiedly
described by a single conformally symmetric Green's function. Sources and
fields are treated at a same footing, symmetrically, as discrete fields - the
fields in this new representation - fields defined with support on straight
lines embedded in a (3+1)-Minkowski manifold. The discrete field turns out to
be a point in phase space. It is finite everywhere. With a finite number of
degrees of freedom it does not share the well known problems faced by the
standard continuous formalism which can be retrieved from the discrete one by
an integration over a hypersurface. The passage from discrete to continuous
fields illuminates the physical meaning and origins of their properties and
problems. The price for having massive discrete field with conformal symmetry
is of hiding its mass and time-like velocity behind its non-constant

the violation Bell's inequality by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type
correlations. The idea of these experiments being that: (i) Bell's inequality
is a consequence of locality, hence its experimental violation is an indication
of non locality; (ii) this violation is a typical quantum phenomenon because
any classical system making local choices (either deterministic or random) will
produce correlations satisfying this inequality. Both statements (i) and (ii)
have been criticized by quantum probability on theoretical grounds (not
discussed in the present paper) and the experiment discussed below has been
devised to support these theoretical arguments. We emphasize that the goal of
our experiment is not to reproduce classically the EPR correlations but to
prove that there exist perfectly local classical dynamical systems violating
Bell's inequality.

an individual particle in an ensemble in detail; 2) Entanglement is a property
of the wave function of a quantum particle(such as an molecule in a liquid NMR
sample). Separability of the density matrix can not be used to measure the
entanglement of mixed ensemble; 3)The evolution of states in bulk-ensemble NMR
quantum computation is quantum mechanical; 4) The coefficient before the
effective pure state density matrix, $\epsilon$, is an measure of the
simultaneity of the molecules in an ensemble. It reflects the intensity of the
NMR signal and has no significance in quantifying the entanglement in the bulk

containing a region with closed time-like curves (time-machine spacetime) is
considered with the help of the path-integral technique. It is argued that, in
certain conditions, a sort of superselection may exist for evolution of a
particle in such a spacetime. All types of evolution are classified by the
number $n$ defined as the number of times the particle returns back to its
past. It corresponds also to the topological class of trajectories of the
particle. The evolutions corresponding to different values of $n$ are
non-coherent. The amplitudes corresponding to such evolutions may not be
superposed. Instead of one evolution operator, as in the conventional
(coherent) description, evolution of the particle is described by a family
$U_n$ of partial evolution operators. This is done in analogy with the
formalism of quantum theory of measurements, but with essential new features in
the dischronal region (the region with closed time-like curves) of the
time-machine spacetime. Partial evolution operators $U_n$ are equal to
integrals over the topological classes of paths if the evolution begins and
ends in the chronal regions. If the evolution begins or/and ends in the
dischronal region, the integral over the topological class should be multiplied
by a certain projector to give the partial evolution operator $U_n$. Thus
defined partial evolution operators possess the property of generalized
unitarity and multiplicativity. The part of evolution containing repeated
returning backward in time cannot be factorized: all backward passages of the
particle have to be considered as a single act, that cannot be presented as
gradually, step by step, passing through `causal loops'.

properly designing such loops the non-trivial curvature of the underlying
bundle geometry gives rise to unitary transformations i.e., holonomies that
implement the desired unitary transformations. Conditions necessary for
universal QC are stated in terms of the curvature associated to the non-abelian
gauge potential (connection) over the control manifold. In view of their
geometrical nature the holonomic gates are robust against several kind of
perturbations and imperfections. This fact along with the adiabatic fashion in
which gates are performed makes in principle HQC an appealing way towards

This paper describes and analyzes possible designs for subsequent, LIGO-III

conventional broad-band interferometer (without signal recycling), except for
new input and/or output optics. Three designs are analyzed: (i) a
""squeezed-input interferometer"" (conceived by Unruh based on earlier work of

injected into the interferometer's dark port; (ii) a ""variational-output""

be produced by sending ordinary squeezed light through two successive
Fabry-Perot filter cavities before injection into the interferometer, and
FD-homodyne detection can be achieved by sending the output light through two
filter cavities before ordinary homodyne detection. With anticipated technology

overcome the above problem is accounting for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
effect. Namely, if the scalar (Higgs) field was presented by a single coherent
quantum state at the initial instant of time, then its reduction during a phase
transition at some later instant should be correlated even at distances
exceeding the local cosmological horizon. Consideration of a simplest
one-dimensional cosmological model with Z_2 Higgs field demonstrates that EPR
correlations can substantially reduce the probability of spontaneous creation
of the domain walls, and such effect seems to be even more promising in the
cases of two- and three-dimensional geometry.

a cavity with variable parameters. The atom in the ground state located in the
initially empty cavity can be excited by variation of cavity parameters. We
have discovered two mechanisms of atomic excitation. The first arises due to
the interaction of the atom with the non-stationary electromagnetic field
created by modulation of cavity parameters. If the characteristic time of
variation of cavity parameters is of the order of the atomic transition time,
the processes of photon creation and atomic excitation are going on
simultaneously and hence excitation of the atom cannot be reduced to trivial
absorption of the photons produced by the dynamical Casimir effect. The second
mechanism is ""shaking"" of the atom due to fast modulation of its ground state
Lamb shift which takes place as a result of fast variation of cavity arameters.
The last mechanism has no connection with the vacuum dynamical Casimir effect.
Moreover, it opens a new channel of photon creation in the non-stationary
cavity. Nevertheless, the process of photon creation is altered by the presence
of the atom in the cavity, even if one disregards the existence of the new
channel. In particular, it removes the restriction for creation of only even
number of photons and also changes the expectation value for the number of

$\rho = \sum_i p_i \rho_i$ of quantum states, the states $\rho_i$ being mixed,

relationship between prior and posterior states in a quantum measurement? In
this paper we show that there are many surprisingly strong constraints on these
mixing and measurement processes that can be expressed simply in terms of the
eigenvalues of the quantum states involved. These constraints capture in a
succinct fashion what it means to say that a quantum measurement acquires
information about the system being measured, and considerably simplify the
proofs of many results about entanglement transformation.

state of Cs_2. First, an absolute value of the triplet scattering length of
^{133}Cs_2 is determined using the experimental data (Fioretti et al,
Eur.Phys.J. 5, 389 (1999)). We demonstrate that the large scattering length can
be made small and positive by coupling of the ^3\Sigma_u^+ (6S + 6S) potential
to the ^3\Pi_g state by strong off-resonant radiation. A weaker laser field
coupling the ^3\Sigma_u^+ (6S + 6S) continuum to the lowest bound level of the
excited ^3\Sigma_g^+ (6S + 6P) also leads to a small positive scattering
length. In addition, the scattering length of the ^{135}Cs isotope is found to
be positive. The method used solves the Schroedinger equation for two
electronic states coupled by an electromagnetic field with approximations
employed. The scattering length is determined from calculated continuum
wavefunctions of low energy.

configuration space. We thus derive a variety of well-defined formulas for the
probabilities for trajectories associated with the solutions to the

trajectories in configuration space. The ``measured'' wave functions still
satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, except for small corrections due to the
disturbance of the measuring device. With modified boundary conditions, the
measurement amplitudes essentially agree with an earlier result of Hartle
derived on rather different grounds. In the special case where the system is a

genuine tests against local realism. In the second part, basing on simple
geometrical properties of Hilbert space, new, stronger Bell inequalities for M

Entanglement between the Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the Welcher-Weg

invariants of probabilistic observation without assuming physical structure.
Structure emerges from the basic assumption of science that new information
shall lead to more accurate knowledge of the invariants. This leads to
statistically unique random variables for expressing observed information:
Complex probability amplitudes. Predictions are also just random variables
computed from observed data, and must become more accurate with more
observations as input. This singles out the quantum mechanical superposition
principle. The external conditions of a probabilistic experiment can themselves
be monitored at the most detailed level, resulting in observation of coicidence
probabilities. The invariants of any multi-coincidence experiment are the same
as those of a one-event experiment with the same number of possible outcomes.
An observable probability turns out to be controllable by two independent
experimental conditions, naturally parametrized as a direction in a
3-dimensional space. In summary, the probabilistic paradigm itself defines a
unique method of forming concepts and making predictions. The method appears
irrefutable within probability, because, whenever a prediction turns out wrong
the existence of an as yet unmonitored condition is postulated, and a formal
way to incoroporate it is shown. The Hilbert space formalism of quantum theory
seems to be isomorphic to this method.

been successfully applied to a variety of problems in language. Several
striking similarities between quantum mechanics and analogical modeling have
recently been noted: (1) traditional statistics can be derived from a
non-statistical basis by assuming data occurrences are accessed through a
spin-up state (given two equally probable quantum states, spin-up and
spin-down); (2) the probability of predicting a particular outcome is
determined by the squaring of an underlying linear measure and is the result of
decoherence (which occurs when a quantum system is observed); and (3) a natural
measure of certainty (called the agreement) is based on one chance of guessing
the right outcome and corresponds to the integrated squaring of Schroedinger's
wave equation.
  Analogical modeling considers all possible combiantions of a given context of
n variables, which is classical terms leads to an exponential explosion on the
order of 2**n. This paper proposes a quantum computational solution to this
exponentiality by applying a cycle of reversible quantum operators to all 2**n

and are defined with respect to some bigger physical system which contains the
former system as a subsystem. Hence, the bigger system acts as a reference
system. It is shown that quantum mechanics can be reformulated in accordance
with this new physical assumption. There is an important consequence of this
dependence: states may not be comparable, i.e., they cannot be checked by
suitable measurements simultaneously. This special circumstance is fully
reflected mathematically by the theory. Especially, it is shown that certain
joint probabilities (or the corresponding combined events) which play a vital
role in any proof of Bell's theorem do not exist. The conclusion is that the
principle of locality is fully valid in quantum mechanics, and one has to give
up instead of locality an intuitively natural-looking feature of realism,

astrophysical data can be used to establish small bounds on the risk of a
""killer strangelet"" catastrophe scenario in the RHIC and ALICE collider
experiments. DDH and other commentators (initially including BJSW) suggested
that these empirical bounds alone do give sufficient reassurance. This seems
unsupportable when the bounds are expressed in terms of expected cost -- a good
measure, according to standard risk analysis arguments. For example, DDH's main
bound, $p_{\rm catastrophe} < 2 \times 10^{-8}$, implies only that the
expectation value of the number of deaths is bounded by 120. This paper
reappraises the DDH and BJSW risk bounds by comparing risk policy in other
areas. For example, it is noted that, even if highly risk tolerant assumptions
are made and no value is placed on the lives of future generations, a
catastrophe risk no higher than $\approx 10^{-15}$ per year would be required
for consistency with established policy for radiation hazard risk minimization.
It is concluded that the costs of small risks of catastrophe have been
significantly underestimated by BJSW (initially), by DDH and by other
commentators. Lessons for future policy are proposed.

eigenvalue. In that case, the physical Hilbert space is obtained by projecting
onto the kernel of Q, i.e. H_phys = ker(Q) = ker(Q*). It is, however,
nontrivial to identify and project onto H_phys when zero is not in the point
spectrum but instead is in the continuous spectrum of Q, because in this case
the kernel of Q is empty.
  Here, we observe that the topology of the underlying Hilbert space can be
harmlessly modified in the direction perpendicular to the constraint surface in
such a way that Q becomes non-self-adjoint. This procedure then allows us to
conveniently obtain H_phys as the proper Hilbert subspace H_phys = ker(Q*), on
which one can project as usual. In the simplest case, the necessary change of
topology amounts to passing from an L^2 Hilbert space to a Sobolev space.

the positivity of the sojourn time, conditional on eventual reflection or

concomitant with the mismatch, however small, due to the very clock
potential($iV_{i}$) introduced for the purpose, as also by any prompt
scattering involving partial waves that have not traversed the region of
interest. We propose a formal procedure whereby the sojourn time so clocked can
be corrected for these spurious scattering effects. The resulting conditional
sojourn times are then positive definite for an arbitrary potential, and have
the proper high- and low-energy limits.

"1413","Classical simulation of quantum entanglement without local hidden
  variables","Serge Massar|Dave Bacon|Nicolas Cerf|Richard Cleve","  Recent work has extended Bell's theorem by quantifying the amount of
communication required to simulate entangled quantum systems with classical
information. The general scenario is that a bipartite measurement is given from
a set of possibilities and the goal is to find a classical scheme that
reproduces exactly the correlations that arise when an actual quantum system is
measured. Previous results have shown that, using local hidden variables, a
finite amount of communication suffices to simulate the correlations for a Bell
state. We extend this in a number of ways. First, we show that, when the
communication is merely required to be finite {\em on average}, Bell states can
be simulated {\em without} any local hidden variables. More generally, we show
that arbitrary positive operator valued measurements on systems of $n$ Bell
states can be simulated with $O(n 2^n)$ bits of communication on average
(again, without local hidden variables). On the other hand, when the
communication is required to be {\em absolutely bounded}, we show that a finite
number of bits of local hidden variables is insufficent to simulate a Bell
state. This latter result is based on an analysis of the non-deterministic
communication complexity of the NOT-EQUAL function, which is constant in the
quantum model and logarithmic in the classical model.

ferroelectric properties of microtubular arrangements. Ferroelectricity is
essential in providing the necessary isolation against thermal losses in thin
interior regions, full of ordered water, near the tubulin dimer walls of the
microtubule. These play the role of cavity regions, which are similar to
electromagnetic cavities of quantum optics. As a result, the formation of

entangled states is the region outside two parallel hyperplanes, which sandwich
the set of all separable states. The states for which these neighborhoods are
largest are the maximally entangled ones. As the number of particles, or the
dimensions of the Hilbert spaces for two of the particles increases, the
distance between two of the hyperplanes which sandwich the separable states
goes to zero. It is easy to decide if a state Q is in the neighborhood of
entangled states we construct for an entangled state E. One merely has to check

measurements bring a disturbance to the system being measured. We consider two
observers who initially assign identical mixed-state density operators to a
two-state quantum system. The question we address is to what extent one
observer can, by measurement, increase the purity of his density operator
without affecting the purity of the other observer's. If there were no
restrictions on the first observer's measurements, then he could carry this out
trivially by measuring the initial density operator's eigenbasis. If, however,
the allowed measurements are those of finite strength---i.e., those
measurements strictly within the interior of the convex set of all
measurements---then the issue becomes significantly more complex. We find that
for a large class of such measurements the first observer's purity increases
the most precisely when there is some loss of purity for the second observer.
More generally the tradeoff between the two purities, when it exists, forms a
monotonic relation. This tradeoff has potential application to quantum state
control and feedback.

The number of resonance states in this system increases as the strength of the
driving field is increased, indicating that this system might have increased
stability against ionization when the field strength is very high. We find that
the newly created resonance states are scarred on unstable periodic orbits of
the classical motion. The behavior of these periodic orbits as the field
strength is increased may explain why there are more resonance states at high
field strengths than at low field strengths. Close examination of an avoided
crossing between resonance states shows that this type of avoided crossing does
not delocalize the resonance states, although it may lead to interesting

aspects of their evolution which are relevant to the transition from quantum to
classical. We begin with a discussion of the conditional dynamics of simple
systems. The resulting models are straightforward but suffice to illustrate
basic physical ideas behind quantum measurements and decoherence. To discuss
decoherence and environment-induced superselection einselection in a more
general setting, we sketch perturbative as well as exact derivations of several
master equations valid for various systems. Using these equations we study
einselection employing the general strategy of the predictability sieve.
Assumptions that are usually made in the discussion of decoherence are
critically reexamined along with the ``standard lore'' to which they lead.
Restoration of quantum-classical correspondence in systems that are classically
chaotic is discussed. The dynamical second law -it is shown- can be traced to
the same phenomena that allow for the restoration of the correspondence
principle in decohering chaotic systems (where it is otherwise lost on a very
short time-scale). Quantum error correction is discussed as an example of an
anti-decoherence strategy. Implications of decoherence and einselection for the
interpretation of quantum theory are briefly pointed out.

\lambda (measured value corresponding to zero relative momentum {\bf p} of two
registered identical pions or kaons) of the two-particle correlation function
C(p,K). The approach uses q-deformed oscillators and the related picture of
ideal gas of q-bosons. In effect, the intercept \lambda is connected with
deformation parameter q. For a fixed value of q, the model predicts specific
dependence of \lambda on pair mean momentum {\bf K} so that, when |{\bf
K}|\gsim 500 - 600 MeV/c for pions or when |{\bf K}|\gsim 700 - 800 MeV/c for

intercepts \lambda_\pi and \lambda_K essentially differ at small mean momenta
{\bf K}, but tend to be equal at {\bf K} large enough (|{\bf K}|\gsim 800MeV/c)

Most importantly, H_PF must have an isolated ground state band for |p| < p_c <=

may terminate. This structure demands a local approximation theorem, in the
sense that the one- particle approximation holds until the semi-classical

Schrodinger equation (quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation) can be regarded as

Opinions as to their significance differ. Some argue that they do play a
fundamental role as actual particle trajectories, others regard them as mere
metaphysical appendages without any physical significance. Recent work has
claimed that in some cases the Bohm approach gives results that disagree with
those obtained from standard quantum mechanics and, in consequence, with
experiment. Furthermore it is claimed that these trajectories have such
unacceptable properties that they can only be considered as `surreal'. We
re-examine these questions and show that the specific objections raised by
Englert, Scully, Sussmann and Walther cannot be sustained. We also argue that
contrary to their negative view, these trajectories can provide a deeper
insight into quantum processes.

state of motion of the particle under the influence of a force field. As is
seen from the results obtained, the ability to influence the course of time
represents one of the most fundamental properties of any material system
intrinsically inherent in it by the very nature of things, which manifests
itself when the system interacts with force fields. The inferences of the paper
are not based on the use of any hypotheses and strictly follow from
relativistic equations of motion. The dependence of the course of time upon the
behaviour of physical system is, thus, a direct consequence of causality
principle, relativity principle and the pseudoeuclidity of space-time. The
results obtained confirm the Kozyrev hypothesis that time has physical
properties and open up radically new opportunities for the efficient control of

the course of time results in the appearance of an additional force acting on
the particle. A general conclusion is drawn on the basis of the theory advanced

In our model, the entire resource for the quantum computation is provided

a large number of qubits. Information is then written onto the cluster,
processed, and read out form the cluster by one-particle measurements only. The
entangled state of the cluster thus serves as a universal substrate for any
quantum computation. Cluster states can be created efficiently in any system

times between different fluxoid states of a SQUID by using ``adiabatic
inversion'' is discussed. One fluxoid state is smoothly transferred into the
other, like a spin reversing direction by following a slowly moving magnetic
field. This is accomplished by sweeping an external applied flux, and depends
on a well-defined quantum phase between the two macroscopic states. Varying the
speed of the sweep relative to the decoherence time permits one to move from
the quantum regime, where such a well-defined phase exists, to the classical
regime where it is lost and the inversion is inhibited. Thus observing whether
inversion has taken place or not as a function of sweep speed offers the
possibility of measuring the decoherence time. Estimates with some typical
SQUID parameters are presented and it appears that such a procedure should be
experimentally possible.
  The main requirement for the feasibility of the scheme appears to be that the
low temperature relaxation time among the quantum levels of the SQUID be long
compared to other time scales of the problem, including the readout time.
Applications to the ``quantum computer'', with the level system of the SQUID
playing the role of the qbit, are briefly examined.

point out that there is indeed a problem with applying the Jaynes principle of
maximum entropy to more than one copy of a system, but the nature of this

additional assumption that the state $\rho^{(N)}$ of the $N$ copies of the

assumption is valid, then a certain locality condition must fail. This locality
condition expresses the idea that what an experimenter freely chooses to

conform closely to the predictions of quantum theory in such cases, but the
most reasonable conclusion to draw is not that locality fails, but rather that
the hidden-variable assumption is false. For this assumption conflicts with the

sequences superposed on the semiclassical dynamics reflecting the underlying

demonstrated as one of the higher dimensional effects displayed in this system.

linearly polarized laser field within a classical model. We propose that all
trajectories leading to non-sequential double ionization pass close to a saddle
in phase space which we identify and characterize. The saddle lies in a two
degree of freedom subspace of symmetrically escaping electrons. The
distribution of longitudinal momenta of ions as calculated within the subspace
shows the double hump structure observed in experiments. Including a symmetric
bending mode of the electrons allows us to reproduce the transverse ion
momenta. We discuss also a path to sequential ionization and show that it does
not lead to the observed momentum distributions.

potential measure of a type of entanglement of pure states of n qubits, the
n-tangle. For a system of two qubits the n-tangle is equal to the square of the
concurrence, and for systems of three qubits it is equal to the ''residual

of concurrence squared for even n, and use this fact to prove that the n-tangle
is an entanglement monotone. However, the n-tangle is undefined for odd n>3.
Finally we propose a measure related to the n-tangle for mixed state systems of
n qubits, and find an analytical formula for this measure for even n.

Casimir vacuum) at oblique incidence, calculating both photon speed and
polarization states as functions of angle. The analysis is performed in the
framework of nonlinear electrodynamics and we show that many features of the
situation can be extracted solely on the basis of symmetry considerations.
Although birefringence is common in nonlinear electrodynamics it is not
universal; in particular we verify that the Casimir vacuum is not birefringent
at any incidence angle. On the other hand, group velocity is typically not
equal to phase velocity, though the distinction vanishes for special directions
or if one is only working to second order in the fine structure constant. We
obtain an ``effective metric'' that is subtly different from previous results.
The disagreement is due to the way that ``polarization sums'' are implemented
in the extant literature, and we demonstrate that a fully consistent
polarization sum must be implemented via a bootstrap procedure using the
effective metric one is attempting to define. Furthermore, in the case of
birefringence, we show that the polarization sum technique is intrinsically an

is well described by the classical Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of the
associated chaotic strange repeller. This correspondence is demonstrated
utilizing microwave experiments on 2-D n-disk billiard geometries, by
determination of the wave-vector autocorrelation C(\kappa) from the
experimental quantum spectra S_{21}(k). The correspondence is also established
via ""numerical experiments"" that simulate S_{21}(k) and C(\kappa) using
periodic orbit calculations of the quantum and classical resonances.
Semiclassical arguments that relate quantum and classical correlation functions
in terms of fluctuations of the density of states and correlations of particle
density are also examined and support the experimental results. The results
establish a correspondence between quantum spectral correlations and classical
decay modes in an open systems.

a quantum system is prepared in a member of a known, finite set of states, and
the aim is to guess which one with the minimum probability of error. Error free
discrimination is also sometimes possible, if we allow for the possibility of
obtaining inconclusive results. If no prior information about the state is
provided, then it is impractical to try to determine it exactly, and it must be
estimated instead. In addition to reviewing these various strategies, I
describe connections between state discrimination, the manipulation of quantum
entanglement, and quantum cloning. Recent experimental work is also discussed.

laser is revisited. Starting from the Scully-Lamb master equation, we present a
fully analytical treatment to determine the correlation function and the
spectrum of the cavity field at steady state. For this purpose, we develop an
analytical approximation method that implicitly incorporates the microscopic
fluctuations of both the phase and intensity of the field, and, in addition,
takes full account of the saturation of the nonlinear gain. Our main result is
a simple formula for the quantum-limited linewidth that is valid from near to
far above threshold and also includes the presence of thermal photons. Close to
the threshold, the linewidth is twice as large as predicted by the standard
phase-diffusion treatment neglecting intensity fluctuations, and even 50% above
threshold the increase is still considerable. In general, quantum fluctuations
of the intensity are present and continue to influence the linewidth as long as
the photon-number distribution is not strictly Poissonian. This inherent
relationship is displayed by a formula relating the linewidth and the Mandel
Q-parameter. More than 100% above treshold the linewidth is found to be smaller
than predicted by the standard treatment, since the simple phase-diffusion
model increasingly overestimates the rate of phase fluctuations by neglecting
gain saturation. In the limit of a very large mean photon number the expected
perfectly coherent classical field is obtained.

of two parts. The first part of the algorithm is to generalize Grover's

to solve a counting problem to determine l.
  In this paper, we study the multi-object quantum search algorithm (in

availability of partial information. The modeling of available partial
information is done simply by the combination of several prescribed, possibly
overlapping, information sets with varying weights to signify the reliability

efficiency and complexity are analyzed.
  Our analysis shows that the search algorithm described here may not be more

there is ``misplaced confidence''. However, if the information sets have a
``basic confidence'' property in the sense that each information set contains
at least one search item, then a quadratic speedup holds on a much smaller data

  Spins","J. Emerson|L. E. Ballentine","  The conditions of quantum-classical correspondence for a system of two
interacting spins are investigated. Differences between quantum expectation
values and classical Liouville averages are examined for both regular and
chaotic dynamics well beyond the short-time regime of narrow states. We find
that quantum-classical differences initially grow exponentially with a
characteristic exponent consistently larger than the largest Lyapunov exponent.
We provide numerical evidence that the time of the break between the quantum
and classical predictions scales as log(${\cal J}/ \hbar$), where ${\cal J}$ is
a characteristic system action. However, this log break-time rule applies only
while the quantum-classical deviations are smaller than order hbar. We find
that the quantum observables remain well approximated by classical Liouville
averages over long times even for the chaotic motions of a few
degree-of-freedom system. To obtain this correspondence it is not necessary to
introduce the decoherence effects of a many degree-of-freedom environment.

in solvable groups, testing equality of subgroups in a given solvable group,
and testing normality of a subgroup in a given solvable group, reduce to
computing orders of solvable groups and therefore admit polynomial-time quantum
algorithms as well. Our algorithm works in the setting of black-box groups,
wherein none of these problems can be computed classically in polynomial time.
As an important byproduct, our algorithm is able to produce a pure quantum

factor groups of solvable groups.

multiparticle entanglement properties of $\rho$. We apply these observations to
analyze two recent experiments, where multiparticle entangled states of 3 (4)

This requires perfect homodyne detection of the atomic emission, and
instantaneous feedback. Inefficient detection was considered previously by two
of us. Here we allow for a non-zero delay time $\tau$ in the feedback circuit.
Because a two-level atom is a nonlinear optical system, an analytical solution
is not possible. However, quantum trajectories allow a simple numerical
simulation of the resulting non-Markovian process. We find the effect of the
time delay to be qualitatively similar to that of inefficient detection. The
solution of the non-Markovian quantum trajectory will not remain fixed, so that

spectral broadening incurred by repeated measurements. This control can yield
either the inhibition (Zeno effect) or the acceleration (anti-Zeno effect) of
the quasi-exponential decay of the observed state by means of frequent
measurements. In the discussed scheme, a photon is bouncing back and forth
between two perfect mirrors, each time passing a polarization rotator. The
horizontal and vertical polarizations can be viewed as analogs of an excited
and a ground state of a two level system (TLS). A polarization beam splitter
and an absorber for the vertically polarized photon are inserted between the
mirrors, and effect measurements of the polarization. The polarization angle
acquired in the electrooptic polarization rotator can fluctuate randomly, e.g.,
via noisy modulation. In the absence of an absorber the polarization
randomization corresponds to TLS decay into an infinite-temperature reservoir.
The non-Markovian nature of the decay stems from the many round-trips required
for the randomization. We consider the influence of the polarization
measurements by the absorber on this non-Markovian decay, and develop a theory
of the Zeno and anti-Zeno effects in this system.

inadequate: the usual interpretation of the mathematical formalism in terms of

nothing that can be called a measurement happens at the moment of observation.
Attempts to force such observations into the standard mould lead to absurd

correct when the experiment does indeed consist of a series of measurements,
and that it is not when the experiment consists of a period of observation:
quantum jumps do happen. The possibilities for improving the formalism by
incorporating transitions in the basic postulates are reviewed, and a
satisfactory postulate is obtained by modifying a suggestion of Bell's. This
requires a distinction between the external description of the whole of a

in the system. It is shown that this gives correct results for simple unstable

state of the pointer, which is the result of its interaction with the spin, is
transformed into a mixed state by the coupling of the pointer to the
environment. The environment is considered to be a gas reservoir, whose
particles interact with the pointer. This results in a Fokker-Planck equation
for the reduced density matrix of the pointer. The solution of the equation
shows that the quantum coherences, which are characteristic to the entangled

anharmonicities of the trap are quantified in terms of the deformation
parameter $\tau $ characterizing the q-analog of the harmonic oscillator trap.
Initially the ion is prepared in a Schr\""{o}dinger cat state. The entanglement
of the center of mass motional states and the internal degrees of freedom of
the ion results in characteristic collapse and revival pattern. We calculate
numerically the population inversion I(t), quasi-probabilities $Q(t),$ and
partial mutual quantum entropy S(P), for the system as a function of time.
Interestingly, small deformations of the trap enhance the contrast between
population inversion collapse and revival peaks as compared to the zero
deformation case. For \beta =3 and $4,(% \beta $ determines the average number
of trap quanta linked to center of mass motion) the best collapse and revival
sequence is obtained for \tau =0.0047 and \tau =0.004 respectively. For large
values of \tau decoherence sets in accompanied by loss of amplitude of
population inversion and for \tau \sim 0.1 the collapse and revival phenomenon
disappear. Each collapse or revival of population inversion is characterized by
a peak in S(P) versus t plot. During the transition from collapse to revival
and vice-versa we have minimum mutual entropy value that is S(P)=0. Successive
revival peaks show a lowering of the local maximum point indicating a
dissipative irreversible change in the ionic state. Improved definition of
collapse and revival pattern as the anharminicity of the trapping potential

  perpetuum mobile of the second kind","Th. M. Nieuwenhuizen|A. E. Allahverdyan","  The Brownian motion of a quantum particle in a harmonic confining potential
and coupled to a harmonic quantum thermal bath is exactly solvable. It is shown
that at low enough temperatures the stationary state is non-Gibbsian due to an
entanglement with the bath. In physical terms, this happens when the cloud of
bath modes around the particle starts to play a non-trivial role. Indeed,
equilibrium thermodynamics of the total system, particle plus bath, does not
imply standard equilibrium thermodynamics for the particle itself at low $T$.
Various formulations of the second law are found to be invalid at low $T$.
First, the Clausius inequality can be violated, because heat can be extracted
from the zero point energy of the cloud of bath modes. Second, when the width
of the confining potential is suddenly changed, there occurs a relaxation to
equilibrium during which the entropy production is partly negative. Third, for
non-adiabatic changes of system parameters the rate of energy dissipation can
be negative, and, out of equilibrium, cyclic processes are possible which
extract work from the bath. Conditions are put forward under which perpetuum
mobile of the second kind, having one or several work extraction cycles, enter
the realm of condensed matter physics. Fourth, it follows that the equivalence
between different formulations of the second law (e.g. those by Clausius and
Thomson) can be violated at low temperatures. These effects are the consequence
of quantum entanglement in the presence of the slightly off-equilibrium nature
of the thermal bath, and become important when the characteristic quantum time
scale $\hbar/k_BT$ is larger than or comparable to other timescale of the
system. They show that there is no general consensus between standard
thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.

  Quantum Theory","J. J. Halliwell","  This paper explores the possibility that an exactly decoherent set of

distortions of the operators characterizing the histories. In particular, for
the case of histories of positions and momenta, this is achieved by doubling
the set of operators and then finding, amongst this enlarged set, new position
and momentum operators which commute, so decohere exactly, and which are
``close'' to the original operators. The enlarged, exactly decoherent, theory
has the same classical dynamics as the original one, and coincides with the
so-called deterministic quantum theories of the type recently studied by 't
Hooft. These results suggest that the comparison of standard and deterministic
quantum theories may provide an alternative method of characterizing emergent
classicality. A side-product is the surprising result that histories of momenta
in the quantum Brownian motion model (for the free particle in the
high-temperature limit) are exactly decoherent.

which are uniformly valid for all angles, are then used to describe the
semiclassical scattering of waves by potentials varying sinusoidally in one
direction. In such situations, for instance in the diffraction of atoms by
gratings made of light, it is common to make the Raman-Nath approximation which
ignores the motion of the atoms inside the grating. When using the

the evolution of a $K^0\bar{K}^0$ quantum entangled pair (created in the decay

theorem, that the most general local hidden-variable model fails in reproducing
the whole set of quantum-mechanical joint probabilities. We achieve these
conclusion by employing two different approaches. In a first one the local
realistic observables are deduced from the most general premises concerning
locality and realism, and Bell-like inequalities are not employed. The other
approach makes use of Bell's inequalities. Within the former scheme, under
particular conditions for the detection times, the discrepancy between quantum
mechanics and local realism for the time-dependent asymmetry turns out to be
not less than 20%. The same incompatibility can be made evident by means of a
Bell-type test by employing both Wigner's and (once properly normalized
probabilities are used) Clauser-Holt-Shimony-Holt's inequalities. Because of
the relatively low experimental accuracy, the data obtained by the CPLEAR
collaboration for the asymmetry parameter do not allow for a decisive test of
local realism. Such a test, both with and without the use of Bell's

two parties, Alice (A) and Bob (B), may be more disordered locally than
globally. That is, S(A) > S(A,B), where S(.) is the von Neumann entropy. It is
known that satisfaction of this inequality implies that a state is
non-separable. In this paper we prove the stronger result that for separable
states the vector of eigenvalues of the density matrix of system AB is
majorized by the vector of eigenvalues of the density matrix of system A alone.
This gives a strong sense in which a separable state is more disordered
globally than locally and a new necessary condition for separability of
bipartite states in arbitrary dimensions. We also investigate the extent to
which these conditions are sufficient to characterize separability, exhibiting
examples that show separability cannot be characterized solely in terms of the
local and global spectra of a state. We apply our conditions to give a simple
proof that non-separable states exist sufficiently close to the completely

described by the Duffing equation, and the chaotic oscillations near the

stable oscillations depend on the physical parameters and initial conditions
sensitively. The first-order necessary condition indicates that the Melnikov
function is equal to zero, so the stable oscillations are Melnikov chaotic. For
the ordinary parameters and initial conditions, the chaotic dynamics is
simulated with numerical calculation. If the damping is absent, with the
increasing of the trap asymmetry, the regular oscillations become chaotic
gradually, the corresponding stroboscopic Poincare sections (SPS) vary from a
single island to more islands, and then the chaotic sea. For the completely
chaotic oscillations, the long-term localization disappears and the short-term
localization can be changed from one of the BECs to the other through the route
of Rabi oscillation. When there exists damping, the stationary chaos
disappears, the transient chaos is a common phenomenon before regular stable
frequency locked oscillations. And proper damping can keep localization

the coherent states are simply ordinary coherent states labeled by points in an
infinite-dimensional linear phase space. Gauge symmetry is imposed by
projecting the original coherent states onto the gauge-invariant subspace,
using a suitable regularization procedure. We obtain in this way a new family
of ""reduced"" coherent states labeled by points in the reduced phase space,
which in this case is simply the cotangent bundle of the structure group K.
  The main result explained here, obtained originally in a joint work of the
author with B. Driver, is this: The reduced coherent states are precisely those
associated to the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform for K, as introduced by
the author from a different point of view. This result agrees with that of K.

reduction.

related to a new universal constant now known as Planck's constant. Despite the
following progress of thus initiated ""quantum mechanics"", the physical origin
of both quantization and universality of Planck's constant remains mysterious,
as well as other ""peculiar"" properties of quantum dynamics. In this paper we
review a recent causal extension of quantum mechanics consistently explaining
all its ""mysteries"" by irreducibly complex, ""dynamically multivalued"" behaviour
of the underlying system of two interacting protofields (quant-ph/9902015,
quant-ph/9902016). The theory contains no imposed postulates or entities except
one, unavoidable assumption about the physical nature of the protofields. All
the observed entities and their properties, starting from physically real
space, time, and elementary particle structure, are consistently derived, in
exact correspondence with their emergence in real, irreducibly complex system
dynamics. The latter provides also natural (dynamic) unification of the
causally extended versions of quantum mechanics, relativity, and field theory,
including unification and causal understanding of particle interaction forces.
Realism and wholeness of the obtained world picture are in agreement with the
""absolute reality"" quest of Max Planck and confirm his famous doubts about the
conventional scheme of quantum mechanics (cf. quant-ph/9911107,
quant-ph/0101129). We describe various applications of the obtained results
providing successful solution to many fundamental and practical problems
dangerously stagnating within conventional approaches.

the state of a quantum system, in such a way that the system can be used to
perform, at a later time, the stored transformation almost perfectly on some
other quantum system. Thus programmable quantum gates for quantum information
processing are feasible if some small degree of imperfection is allowed. We
discuss the possibility of using this fact for securely computing a secret
function on a public quantum computer. Finally, our scheme for storage of
operations also allows for a new form of quantum remote control.

determined by the closed orbits of the corresponding classical system; this
relationship is simple and strong for waves in billiards or on manifolds, but
becomes slightly muddy for a Schrodinger equation with a potential, where the
orbits depend on the energy. We discuss several variants of a way to restore
the simplicity by rescaling the coupling constant or the size of the orbit or
both. In each case the relation between the oscillation frequency and the
period of the orbit is inspected critically; in many cases it is observed that
a characteristic length of the orbit is a better indicator. When these matters
are properly understood, the periodic-orbit theory for generic quantum systems
recovers the clarity and simplicity that it always had for the wave equation in
a cavity. Finally, we comment on the alleged ""paradox"" that semiclassical
periodic-orbit theory is more effective in calculating low energy levels than
high ones.

their dynamics through a constraint. We specifically choose the Dirac procedure

theories, and prior to the introduction of any constraints, it is argued that
the original field operator representation should be ultralocal in order to
remain totally unbiased toward those field correlations that will be imposed by
the constraints. It is shown that relativistic free and interacting theories
can be completely recovered starting from ultralocal representations followed
by a careful enforcement of the appropriate constraints. In so doing all
unnecessary features of the original ultralocal representation disappear.
  The present discussion is germane to a recent theory of affine quantum
gravity in which ultralocal field representations have been invoked before the
imposition of constraints.

cipher, the quantum key can be recycled securely. We show that key recycling is
intrinsic to the quantum cipher-text, rather than using entanglement as the
key. Second, the scheme detects and corrects for arbitrary transmission errors,
and it does so using only local operations and classical communication (LOCC)
between the sender and the receiver. The application to quantum message
authentication is discussed. Quantum secret sharing schemes with similar
properties are characterized. We also discuss two general issues, the relation

eavesdropper is allowed to share any density matrix with the two communicating
parties. The density matrix spans all of the photon number states of both
receivers, as well as a probe state of arbitrary dimensionality belonging to
the eavesdropper. Using this general eavesdropping strategy, we show that the
Shannon information on the final key, after error correction and privacy
amplification, can be made exponentially small. This is done by finding a bound
on the eavesdropper's average collision probability. We find that the average
collision probability for the Ekert protocol is the same as that of the BB84
protocol for single photons, indicating that there is no analog in the Ekert
protocol to photon splitting attacks. We then compare the communication rate of
both protocols as a function of distance, and show that the Ekert protocol has
potential for much longer communication distances, up to 170km, in the presence
of realistic detector dark counts and channel loss. Finally, we propose a
slightly more complicated scheme based on entanglement swapping that can lead
to even longer distances of communication. The limiting factor in this new
scheme is the fiber loss, which imposes very slow communication rates at longer

decisive argument for or against its objective existence. In this paper we show
that introducing the issue of determinism gives the debate a new, empirical
twist. We prove that any theory that states that the basic laws of physics are
time-symmetric must be strictly deterministic. It is only determinism that
enables time reversal, whether theoretical or experimental, of
anyentropy-increasing process. A contradiction therefore arises between
Hawking's argument that physical law is time-symmetric and his controversial
claim that black-hole evaporation introduces a fundamental unpredictability
into the physical world. The latter claim forcibly entails an intrinsic
time-arrow independent of boundary conditions. A simulation of a simple system
under time reversal shows how an intrinsic time arrow re-emerges, destroying
the time reversal, when even the slightest failure of determinism occurs. This
proof is then extended to the classical behavior of black holes. We conclude
with pointing out the affinity between time's arrow and its apparent passage.

setting, we prove that i) every partial measurement nonlocally creates the same
partial change in the distant particle; and ii) every erasure inflicts the same
erasure on the distant particle's state. This enables an EPR experiment where
the nonlocal effect does not vanish after a single measurement but keeps
""traveling"" back and forth between particles. We study an experiment in which
two distant particles are subjected to interferometry with a partial ""which
path"" measurement. Such a measurement causes a variable amount of correlation
between the particles. A new inequality is formulated for same-angle
polarizations, extending Bell's inequality for different angles. The resulting
nonlocality proof is highly visualizable, as it rests entirely on the
interference effect. Partial measurement also gives rise to a new form of

used in analysis of the ion dynamics, leads to a transition from a
two-dimensional (2D) to a one-dimensional problem (1D) of electron

in cases of weak and strong interaction between the cites of the 2D cell by
using the methods of resonance perturbation theory, common in analysis of 1D
time-dependent dynamical systems.

annihilation operators. These coherent states are explicitly characterized by
six complex numbers with constraints. For the completely symmetric

coherent states provide a resolution of identity, satisfy the continuity

microsphere of given complex permittivity that satisfies the Kramers-Kronig
relations is studied, with special emphasis on a Drude-Lorentz permittivity.
Both the whispering gallery field resonances below the band gap (for a
dielectric sphere) and the surface-guided field resonances inside the gap (for
a dielectric or a metallic sphere) are considered. Since the decay rate mimics
the spectral density of the sphere-assisted ground-state fluctuation of the
radiation field, the strengths and widths of the field resonances essentially
determine the feasible enhancement of spontaneous decay. In particular, strong
enhancement can be observed for transition frequencies within the interval in
which the surface-guided field resonances strongly overlap. When material
absorption becomes significant, then the highly structured emission pattern
that can be observed when radiative losses dominate reduces to that of a
strongly absorbing mirror. Accordingly, nonradiative decay becomes dominant. In
particular, if the distance between the atom and the surface of the microsphere
is small enough, the decay becomes purely nonradiative.

therefore suspects some modifications of the character of the radiation when
quantum properties of the {\it black hole itself} are properly taken into
account. In fact, during the last three decades evidence has been mounting
that, in a quantum theory of gravity black holes may have a discrete mass
spectrum, with concomitant {\it discrete} line emission. A direct consequence
of this intriguing prediction is that, compared with blackbody radiation,
black-hole radiance is {\it less} entropic, and may therefore carry a
significant amount of {\it information}. Using standard ideas from quantum
information theory, we calculate the rate at which information can be recovered
from the black-hole spectral lines. We conclude that the information that was

is proposed. The model is treated analytically to all orders of the coupling
constant by a method analogous to that used for the Luttinger model. As a first
application, the particle density is evaluated and the behavior of Friedel

attractive interactions tend to suppress the Friedel oscillations while strong
repulsive interactions enhance the Friedel oscillations significantly. The

"1518","Compression of quantum measurement operations","A. Winter|S. Massar","  We generalize recent work of Massar and Popescu dealing with the amount of
classical data that is produced by a quantum measurement on a quantum state
ensemble. In the previous work it was shown how spurious randomness generally
contained in the outcomes can be eliminated without decreasing the amount of
knowledge, to achieve an amount of data equal to the von Neumann entropy of the
ensemble. Here we extend this result by giving a more refined description of
what constitute equivalent measurements (that is measurements which provide the
same knowledge about the quantum state) and also by considering incomplete
measurements. In particular we show that one can always associate to a POVM
with elements a_j, an equivalent POVM acting on many independent copies of the
system which produces an amount of data asymptotically equal to the entropy
defect of an ensemble canonically associated to the ensemble average state and
the initial measurement (a_j). In the case where the measurement is not
maximally refined this amount of data is strictly less than the von Neumann
entropy, as obtained in the previous work. We also show that this is the best
achievable, i.e. it is impossible to devise a measurement equivalent to the
initial measurement (a_j) that produces less data. We discuss the
interpretation of these results. In particular we show how they can be used to
provide a precise and model independent measure of the amount of knowledge that
is obtained about a quantum state by a quantum measurement. We also discuss in
detail the relation between our results and Holevo's bound, at the same time
providing a new proof of this fundamental inequality.

a small amount of entanglement; (ii) that a known, noisy, non-local unitary
operation as well as an unknown, noisy, local unitary operation can be
purified; (iii) how to perform the tomography of arbitrary, unknown, non-local
operations; (iv) that a set of local unitary operations as well as a set of
non-local unitary operations can be stored and compressed; (v) how to implement
probabilistically two-qubit gates for photons. We also show how to compress a
set of bipartite entangled states locally, as well as how to implement certain
non-local measurements using a small amount of entanglement. Finally, we
generalize some of our results to multiparty systems.

"4718","Quantum Database Search can do without Sorting","Apoorva Patel","  Sorting is a fundamental computational process, which facilitates subsequent
searching of a database. It can be thought of as factorisation of the search
process. The location of a desired item in a sorted database can be found by
classical queries that inspect one letter of the label at a time. For an
unsorted database, no such classical quick search algorithm is available. If
the database permits quantum queries, however, then mere digitisation is
sufficient for efficient search. Sorting becomes redundant with the quantum
superposition of states. A quantum algorithm is written down which locates the
desired item in an unsorted database a factor of two faster than the best
classical algorithm can in a sorted database. This algorithm has close
resemblance to the assembly process in DNA replication.

rotor model is demonstrated and its origin in deviations from random matrix
theory is identified. Further, the extent of control in the presence of
external decoherence is established. The results are relevant to both areas of
quantum chaos and coherent control.

"4918","General approach to potentials with two known levels","S. N. Dolya|O. B. Zaslavskii","  We present the general form of potentials with two given energy levels
$E_{1}$, $E_{2}$ and find corresponding wave functions. These entities are
expressed in terms of one function $\xi (x)$ and one parameter $\Delta
E=E_{2}$-$E_{1}$. We show how the quantum numbers of both levels depend on
properties of the function $\xi (x)$. Our approach does not need resorting to
the technique of supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics but automatically
generates both the potential and superpotential.

"5018","Stochastic Theory of Relativistic Particles Moving in a Quantum Field:
  II. Scalar Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac-Langevin Equation, Radiation Reaction and
  Vacuum Fluctuations","Philip R. Johnson|B. L. Hu","  We apply the open systems concept and the influence functional formalism
introduced in Paper I to establish a stochastic theory of relativistic moving
spinless particles in a quantum scalar field. The stochastic regime resting
between the quantum and semi-classical captures the statistical mechanical
attributes of the full theory. Applying the particle-centric world-line
quantization formulation to the quantum field theory of scalar QED we derive a
time-dependent (scalar) Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation and show that it
is the correct semiclassical limit for nonlinear particle-field systems without
the need of making the dipole or non-relativistic approximations. Progressing
to the stochastic regime, we derive multiparticle ALD-Langevin equations for
nonlinearly coupled particle-field systems. With these equations we show how to
address time-dependent dissipation/noise/renormalization in the semiclassical
and stochastic limits of QED. We clarify the the relation of radiation
reaction, quantum dissipation and vacuum fluctuations and the role that initial
conditions may play in producing non-Lorentz invariant noise. We emphasize the
fundamental role of decoherence in reaching the semiclassical limit, which also
suggests the correct way to think about the issues of runaway solutions and
preacceleration from the presence of third derivative terms in the ALD
equation. We show that the semiclassical self-consistent solutions obtained in
this way are ``paradox'' and pathology free both technically and conceptually.
This self-consistent treatment serves as a new platform for investigations into
problems related to relativistic moving charges.

"5122","Hyperbolic quantum mechanics","Andrei Khrennikov","  We start to develop the quantization formalism in a hyperbolic Hilbert space.
Generalizing Born's probability interpretation, we found that unitary
transformations in such a Hilbert space represent a new class of
transformations of probabilities which describe a kind of {\it hyperbolic
interference}. The most interesting problem which was generated by our
investigation is to find experimental evidence of hyperbolic interference. The
hyperbolic quantum formalism can also be interesting as a new theory of
probabilistic waves that can be developed parallely to the standard quantum
theory. Comparative analysis of these two wave theories could be useful for
understanding of the role of various structures of the standard quantum
formalism. In particular, one of distinguishing feature of the hyperbolic
quantum formalism is the restricted validity of the superposition principle.

These conditions allow one to easily check any trace-preserving map for

form. This allows a detailed examination of an important class of non-unital
extreme points which can be characterized as having exactly two images on the
Bloch sphere.
  We also discuss a number of related issues about the images and the geometry
of the set of stochastic maps, and show that any stochastic map on 2x2 matrices
