"1","Maintaining coherence in Quantum Computers","W. G. Unruh","  The effect of the inevitable coupling to external degrees of freedom of a
quantum computer are examined. It is found that for quantum calculations (in
which the maintenance of coherence over a large number of states is important),
not only must the coupling be small but the time taken in the quantum
calculation must be less than the thermal time scale, $\hbar/k_B T$. For longer
times the condition on the strength of the coupling to the external world
becomes much more stringent.

forbidden quantum processes. In addition to ""physical"" values, a realistic
measurement can yield ""unphysical"" values; we show that in {\it sequences} of
measurements, the ""unphysical"" values can form a consistent pattern. An
experiment to isolate a particle in a classically forbidden region obtains a
negative value for its kinetic energy. It is the {\it weak value} of kinetic
energy between past and future state vectors.

groups, that quantum gates operating on just two bits at a time are sufficient
to construct a general quantum circuit. The best previous result had shown the
universality of three-bit gates, by analogy to the universality of the Toffoli
three-bit gate of classical reversible computing. Two-bit quantum gates may be
implemented by magnetic resonance operations applied to a pair of electronic or
nuclear spins. A ``gearbox quantum computer'' proposed here, based on the
principles of atomic force microscopy, would permit the operation of such
two-bit gates in a physical system with very long phase breaking (i.e., quantum
phase coherence) times. Simpler versions of the gearbox computer could be used
to do experiments on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states and related entangled
quantum states.

Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal (WWGM) quantization is analyzed and a
derivative-based approach, alternative to the conventional integral-based one
is developed. Thus the fundamental quantum relations follow in a simpler and
unified manner. An explicit formula for the ordered products of the
Heisenberg-Weyl algebra is obtained. The W(infty) -covariance of the
WWGM-quantization in its most general form is established. It is shown that the
group action of W(infty) that is realized in the classical phase space induces
on bases operators in the corresponding Hilbert space a similarity
transformation generated by the corresponding quantum W(infty) which provides a
projective representation of the former $W_{\infty}$. Explicit expressions for
the algebra generators in the classical phase space and in the Hilbert space
are given. It is made manifest that this W(infty)-covariance of the
WWGM-quantization is a genuine property of the operator bases.

using a particular sequence of exactly five two-bit gates. An arbitrary
three-bit unitary gate, which can be used to build up any arbitrary quantum
computation, can be implemented exactly with six two-bit gates. The ease of
implementation of any particular quantum operation is dependent upon a very
non-classical feature of the operation, its exact quantum phase factor.

Condition, which can be applied to linear relativistic quantum field theories

temperature resulting from LEC is compared to an old approach to local
temperature based on the principle of maximal entropy. It is shown that the

"15","Classical and quantum representation theory","N. P. Landsman","  These notes present an introduction to an analytic version of deformation
quantization. The central point is to study algebras of physical observables
and their irreducible representations. In classical mechanics one deals with
real Poisson algebras, whereas in quantum mechanics the observables have the
structure of a real non-associative Jordan-Lie algebra. The non-associativity
is proportional to $\pl^2$, hence for $\pl\raw 0$ one recovers a real Poisson
algebra. This observation lies at the basis of `strict' deformation
quantization, where one deforms a given Poisson algebra into a $C^*$-algebra,
in such a way that the basic algebraic structures are preserved. Our main
interest lies in degenerate Poisson algebras and their quantization by
non-simple Jordan-Lie algebras. The traditional symplectic manifolds of
classical mechanics, and their quantum counterparts (Hilbert spaces and
operator algebras which act irreducibly) emerge from a generalized
representation theory. This two-step procedure sheds considerable light on the
subject. We discuss a large class of examples, in which the Poisson algebra
canonically associated to an (integrable) Lie algebroid is deformed into the
Jordan-Lie algebra of the corresponding Lie groupoid. A special case of this
construction, which involves the gauge groupoid of a principal fibre bundle,
describes the classical and quantum mechanics of a particle moving in an
external gravitational and Yang-Mills field.

"16","Observation and superselection in quantum mechanics","N. P. Landsman","  We attempt to clarify the main conceptual issues in approaches to
`objectification' or `measurement' in quantum mechanics which are based on
superselection rules. Such approaches venture to derive the emergence of
classical `reality' relative to a class of observers; those believing that the
classical world exists intrinsically and absolutely are advised against reading
this paper. The prototype approach (Hepp) where superselection sectors are
assumed in the state space of the apparatus is shown to be untenable. Instead,
one should couple system and apparatus to an environment, and postulate
superselection rules for the latter. These are motivated by the locality of any
observer or other (actual or virtual) monitoring system. In this way
`environmental' solutions to the measurement problem (Zeh, Zurek) become
consistent and acceptable, too. Points of contact with the modal interpretation
are briefly discussed. We propose a minimal value attribution to observables in
theories with superselection rules, in which only central observables have
properties. In particular, the eigenvector-eigenvalue link is dropped. This is
mainly motivated by Ockham's razor.

universe as a pure quantum state collapses gravitationally into a black hole,
which then evaporates completely into a mixed state of thermal radiation.
Although this proposal is controversial, it is tempting to consider analogous
processes that might occur in certain theories of consciousness. For example,
one might postulate that independent degrees of freedom be ascribed to the
mental world to help explain the feeling of a correlation between one's desires
and one's choice of actions. If so, one might ask whether information in the
physical world can be lost to such postulated degrees of freedom in the mental
world. Or, one might hypothesize that the mental world can affect the physical
world by modifying the quantum action for the physical world in a
coordinate-invariant way (analogous to the alpha parameters in wormhole
theory).

"19","Protective Measurements","Yakir Aharonov|Lev Vaidman","  Protective measurements yield properties of the quantum state of a single
quantum system without affecting the quantum state. A protective measurement
involves adiabatic coupling to the measuring device together with a procedure
to protect the state from changing. For nondegenerate energy eigenstates the
protection is provided by the system itself. In this case it is actually
possible to measure the Schr\""odinger wave via measurements on a single system.
This fact provides an argument in favor of associating physical reality with a
quantum state of a single system, challenging the usual ensemble
interpretation. We also believe that the complete description of a quantum
system requires a two-state vector formalism involving (in addition to the
usual one)a future quantum state evolving backwards in time. Protective
measurements testing the two-state vector reality are constructed.

optics experiments is recovered and extended to nonresonant transitions, in the

distinction between compact photon number conserving and noncompact photon
number nonconserving squeezing transformations is made. We exploit the
$Sp(4,\Re)-SO(3,2)\/$ local isomorphism and the $U(2)\/$ invariant squeezing
criterion to divide the set of all squeezing transformations into a two
parameter family of distinct equivalence classes with representative elements
chosen for each class. Familiar two mode squeezing transformations in the
literature are recognized in our framework and seen to form a set of measure
zero. Examples of squeezed coherent and thermal states are worked out. The need
to extend the heterodyne detection scheme to encompass all of $U(2)\/$ is
emphasized, and known experimental situations where all $U(2)\/$ elements can
be reproduced are briefly described.
